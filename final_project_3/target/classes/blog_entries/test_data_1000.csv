"Thabo admits defeat on quiet diplomacy  Mbeki  urlLink stated  yesterday that his policy of quiet diplomacy on Zimbabwe has been a failure. Speaking through presidential spokesperson Bheki Khumalo, he said that the talks between the Zanu-PF and MDC were 'too slow' and that no progress had been made on the issue.  However, Mbeki also stated that he would ""press on with his diplomatic efforts in Zimbabwe despite fierce criticism, because he still believed there was no alternative to dialogue."" These is a confusing sentiment. There are many political alternatives to dialogue that include simple public censure and economic pressure.  Mbeki has largely based himself as a foreign policy president, particularly in his first term, and to gain any credibility for NEPAD and his other strong foreign policy initiatives, he must take action on Zimbabwe. After his softening position on AIDS, it is the one factor in his presidency that the world still cannot understand. Struggle friends or not, a dictator is a dictator whatever the historical context, and Mbeki has to show his leadership and take action after this acknolwedgement. Will it happen? Probably not..."	m
Brainbench welcomes its 5 millionth subscriber by announcing free tests from 1st of july through 14th of july 2004. Well.. it really sounds like MUSIC and that too ROCK MUSIC for the ears of brainbench certification aspirants but wait..... all has got jazzed up. What happens when an apple needs to be shared between 1000s of hungry men? of course everyone is left without a piece of it. Thats what exactly has happned with Brainbench. After announcing the free tests they did not take care for the high availability of the data through their servers. For more than half an hour i tried to just login, forget taking any test.  By the way how much difference does it make if you get these certifications. I and may be the community would like to know any success stories. Please share your comments.

"there's nothing else more embarassing in life than being sensitive to everything else around you... i wish sometimes i wasn't so sensitive to everything. maybe even a little more thick skinned... hmm...   i keep thinking about what Vicky asked me the other week, ""Are you always so soft-spoken?"" i was rather shocked. soft-spoken?? told Gary and Fairul, they didn't seem to think so! maybe compared to Vicky i am. heh... one thing she pointed out true though, is that i am a passive aggressive person. not good, i know. =P  work has become incredibly insane lately! i'm already all fatigued out from just two months of work. work that i thought i used to love so much. doesn't it mean something when work has become a burden instead of the very thing you used to enjoy? i wonder...  i'm just trying to hold out. maybe it'll settle down more once we deliver the first batch of three episodes."	f
Today I had a glass artist over for a firing. It was a good excuse to do some research on fused glass. Mypast attempt at painted,fused, and slumped glass turned out so-so. I have some material already, so it would be nice to learn how to use it properly. She is an older woman, and I had a nice time talking about glasswith her; how she sells her stuff (in Venezuela), and just about life as an artist. I custom programmed my kiln (she usually does it manually). It was interesting to know that you can open a red hot flaming kiln with glass inside with no breakage. I can't wait to see what is inside. Learned about cutting glass, slumping in bisque, applying enamels to gum arabic through a sifter, using elmers glue to stick shards of glass together, using a metallic sharpie to write with on glass, and firing inclusions and dichroic glass. Like to test frit on clay and glass. baking soda makes bubbles between glass (use sparingly).Use of fiber paper vs. kiln wash. slump at a higher temperature and fire paint at a lower temp to keep intensity of color.Use ceramic frames for drop molds (dishes) Cracked bisque works fine as a glass saggar!	f

Hey all! How are you? Well, today was pretty good. I went swimming for 3 hours, got a shower, went to see Shrek 2 with Lauren, Brianne, Kristin, Emily, Sarah, and Kendra, and then I came home. Since then, I've been doing absolutely nothing, but I'm ok with that. I'm kinda tired though and my back is killing me, but that's not really anything new. Now, I'm singing Christmas songs to Kendra. Oh, I like this little quote thing       Once in a while,      In the middle of     ordinary life,          Love gives us a     fairy tale.      I just thought that was cute. Ok, well I don't really have much to say. Ok, we're not going swimming. Me, Peter, Kendra, and Stevie..we're not going swimming and I have to say, I'm okay with that. I'd wear my skiing outfit anyways. Aniles? Cafe? Lake? Hmm.. probably. Alright, well I'm done babbling for one night..I'll talk to y'all later. Bye!     love always,       abby	f

Disclaimer: not really a disclaimer lol, but just a few passing comments which to let you know what I'm saying now is not incuded in the article. This is pretty esoteric i might add, not really THAT esoteric as I'm not talking about the origins of the phrygian and its applications, or stuff along that line. But if you're not musically-inclined or do not play an instrument, then this won't be of interest to you, yep.   If you think that tabbing, especially tabbing solos are for people with perfect pitch like Mozart, well, tabbing is not that difficult, it is if you try to figure out every single note without a proper guideline. But, tabbing songs out yourself brings about great benefits, not only if you have a song which you can’t find any tabs for, but it also helps you grow as a musician. By tabbing solos out yourself, you get a better knowledge of scales and how solos are constructed, and it helps in developing pitch recognition…….who knows? Mozart might be transcribing what his sister played in their living room way before he was discovered at 5.  Well, here is a step-by-step guide to tabbing solos.    1. Break it down.   Breaking it down helps you to identify the different musical and beat patterns in the solo. It is really the simplest thing you can do, but also the most important.    2. Sing it out    Before the solos gets to your fingers, it has to get to your mouth. Sing out the solo and make sure it is in perfect pitch. Sing a B when the note playing is a B. Try singing the solo out, it works wonders.    3. Identify the key.    If you have a fairly musical ear, this should not be a problem for you. But if not, there are a few ways which you can do it. Firstly, identify the first note in the solo. If this cannot be done, then look at the intro of the song. What is the first note/chord being played?   Try using 5th chords on your guitar because 5ths possesses neither minor nor major characteristics. Try an E powerchord, followed by an F etc. until you find the chord with suits the pitch of the first note/chord. Never mind if the song has a d minor but you played a D5, you have just found out that the song is in the key of D, and that’s what we need to know……for now.    4. Identify the scale    Before you can identify the scale, you have to take the root note, and do a hit-and-run (i.e. transcribe by ear) at the first 3 to 4 different notes in the solo.  The second step to identify the scale is to make a logical guess. If you have a fairly good knowledge of scales, such a logical guess would not be too big a problem. If possible, identify it just be hearing the solo. But if not, here is how to take the first step to make a logical guess. Firstly, identify the genre, if it is hard rock, mixolydian or the minor pentatonic would be your usual suspects etc.   One tip: Pentatonic scales do not have any semitones unless chromatic passing tones are added to them. So, if there are no semitones in the first 4-5 notes you have figured out, you’re most probably in pentatonic territory, but don’t be too sure at this point.   Secondly, write down the first 3-4 different notes which you have figured out by ear. If you do not have a solid knowledge of scales, get to a website or a programme with a comprehensive list of scales which you can view from. See which scale contains the first 3-4 notes which you have found. If you have a few different scales which share the same 3-4 notes you have found, figure out by ear again 1 or 2 more different notes to narrow it down to only 1 possibility.  This can be the most easiest or the most difficult part depending on the solo and the scale/s used.    5. Write down the individual notes    I generally would not recommend the notes be written in tab, but rather in their names. Like B flat as Bb, instead of the 6th fret on the first string. Use the scale as a guide as to which notes you are “allowed” to use. Start with the root note and sing the pitch of the next note. Navigate till you find the next note. It should not pose too much of a problem if you have identified the scale and are able to sing the next note out.  Never mind, if the actual solo plays the B flat at the 3rd fret on the 3rd string and you started at the first string 6th fret, it is immaterial for now, what matters is that you get the different notes right.  This process could take you a bit of patience; the key is not to lose the pitch as you sing the note which you want to figure out next. Never mind the hammer-ons, pull-offs or bends for now.    6. Use a keyboard/piano    It is amazing how a keyboard or piano can make tabbing out your solos easier. Here are a few advantages.   a.There are no repeat notes, all notes are distinct.   The fact that a keyboard has no repeat notes keep you in focus and won’t make the whole musical landscape seem so vast and complex, you only have to worry about 7 notes (depending on the scale) right now, ignoring the octaves, for now.   b.All accidentals are laid out nicely    Scales are much easier to see and learn, and the lesser possibility of you hitting a note outside of the scale you found out. Hitting a wrong note could very well disorientate your musical senses for a while.   Try using the piano, it works wonders. Figuring out a portion of that Dream Theater solo is no different from figuring out twinkle twinkle little star by ear if done on a piano.    7. Identify octaves    When you have figured out all the individual notes, never mind that it sounds like three blind mice now, its time to figure out which octaves the notes belong to. Remember I said not to worry if the note you figured out is not of the correct octave? Now its time to take that into consideration, you can put aside the piano for a while, every string on the guitar has different timbral qualities when being hit at different frets, so the guitar is now much more suited for this job.  Play all the root notes of the scale in your guitar at all different positions, just the root note. Then, play the first 5-6 notes starting from each different root notes and tweak your ears to find out which octave the root note belongs to.  A process of “substitution” can take place here. Because say, an E can be played on the 12th fret first string but the same E on the same octave can be done on the 17th fret on the 2nd string. What’s most important here, after figuring out which octave it belongs, is simply to find the position which is most comfortable to you.  Remember that as you do this, write down the “raw tab” as I call it, of the different notes in tab, without adding the hammer-ons , pull-offs, the slides etc.    8. Identify techniques    Now it is time to add the harmonics, the slides etc. into the song. Anyone who has some experience on guitar would be able to tell the difference between a slide and hammer-on and know when there is a bend or vibrato. This process is fairly simple. Just add the techniques into the “raw tab” which you just wrote. Say you wrote a C then it goes up to an Eb, and there is a bend to get from the C to Eb in the solo, just simply notate a 3 fret bend on the tab.  When the techniques are all added into the “raw tab”, you can re-write it and voila! You have just successfully tabbed your first solo.   I hope that this guide would be a great help to you. Even though it takes a great deal of patience even with this guide in hand, but I hope that it won’t make tabbing such an impossible task. If you’re thinking “what for?” well, tabbing, like I said, helps develop your musical ear and gives you a greater understanding of scales and how solos are constructed.  Cheers…..and happy tabbing……	m

"urlLink The Organization for Security  Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  has been invited by the State Department to send an observation mission for the Nov. 2 election in the US.  It's tempting to see this as a cave in to pressure from D's in Congress.  Think again.  The State Dept. jumped at this because it isn't a threat.   Anyone who has participated in any OSCE election observation mission (I've been on three) knows that the verdict of the mission will be written by OSCE member state ambassadors, who have political agendas to grind.   Guess who is the most important member state of the OSCE - the US.  Guess who appoints the ambassador to the OSCE - GW Bush.  In January, I wrote a piece for the  urlLink London Sunday Times  on the impending OSCE election observation mission in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, warning of a whitewash (which happened.)  It's a good primer on the OSCE's internal processes.  I pasted it here (you can't get it online unless you subscribe to the Sunday Times.)   Georgia vs. the election observers.   By Tim Russo       ""You're joking,"" my British friend whispered to me as he came to a stop after racing into the building with urgency.    We stood at the back of an old auditorium, packed with international press, government officials, embassy staff, and observers of the 1998 presidential election in Armenia.  The head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) international observation mission sat at a table in the front, calmly reading the delegation's preliminary statement on the conduct of the election the previous day.  I looked down at the ground in stunned silence.  ""I just got back from my count,"" my friend said in disbelief.    ""Have you even showered?"" I asked.  ""Haven't showered in a day and a half,"" he said.  ""We went to the OSCE office, they told us to come here,"" he said.  ""I just got out of the car after an eight hour drive,"" he finished, panting.   I feared what was coming.  He'd just been an observer at a late night vote count in a remote, mountainous border region where military manipulation of the election was expected, and turned out to be particularly egregious.  ""Where do I take these?"" he said waving a stack of notes and documents in the air, his voice now frustrated.  I just looked at him and shook my head, having spent the previous night at an equally farcical vote count myself until 9 a.m. that morning.  He started looking around for someone in charge.  ""What is going on here?  Why is the statement being issued, I haven't even reported from my assignment?""  I just rubbed my forehead as my friend kept charging about the back of the room with his documents, his desperation telling it all about how the election must have gone where he'd observed it.  Then we heard from the podium, ""...a step forward for democracy...""    My friend lost it.  He stopped in his tracks.  I walked over to try and calm him down, but he just looked at me in shock, shoving my outstretched arm away.  ""What a fucking joke...,"" he said with one last wave of his notes, then he threw them to the floor angrily, turned around, and marched out of the building in disgust, as the head of the delegation calmly continued reading his verdict of approval.  Since the soviet collapse, it seems every new election in the post soviet republics deteriorates into more of a sham than the one before it, 2003 proving a banner year for post soviet electoral fraud.  This year, the OSCE, post soviet international election observers of record, condemned various elections in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and even Russia, whose December 7 parliamentary election it described in its preliminary statement as `overwhelmingly distorted'.   The people of Georgia, however, finally refused to accept yet another fraudulent election.  Helped along by the condemnation of election observers (OSCE as well as domestic observers), the people power in the streets of Tbilisi in November forced out the president, Edward Shevardnadze.  Enough had become enough, and now there is great hope for a new era in Georgia of elections free of manipulation, beginning with the presidential election January 4.  As my British friend would agree, Georgia need look no further than its rugged southern border for guidance in the days ahead.  In 1998, Armenia faced very similar circumstances.  A president who relied on electoral fraud to stay in power was forced to resign.  A new election was scheduled, the OSCE descended en masse to observe.  And a similar hope for a future of free and fair elections was in the air.  But Georgians should watch the OSCE as carefully as they watch their election processes, for the OSCE's recent boldness in the aftermath of this year's many sham elections is very recent indeed.    Run by member states, OSCE observation missions exist in a diplomatic no mans land; on the one hand dedicated to promote integrity in the democratic process, but on the other, representing the political and economic policy interests of the member states.  The result is that far from being disinterested guarantors of democratic integrity, OSCE election observation missions, and especially the statements they make in the immediate aftermath of an election, are not unblinking verdicts by a referee, but more often are delicate balancing acts of high diplomacy.  It is a balance the OSCE has often gotten exactly wrong at precisely the wrong moment.  As the new democracies of the former Soviet Union were finding their feet, and member states of the OSCE were assessing the new geopolitical realities, OSCE election observation missions found ever more creative ways to gloss over the ever more fraudulent elections.  Whatever the competing interest, the commitment to helping these new democracies create fair electoral processes regularly took a back seat, with the perverse result that messy elections were not only ignored, but made even messier by the OSCE and the increasing caricature of their increasingly predictable whitewashes.    Armenia's presidential election in 1998 was a prime example.  As an observer within the OSCE mission at the time, I had a front row seat to not only observe the pervasive electoral fraud, but also the OSCE's delicate balancing act between the compelling observations the observers kept reporting, and the member states' interest in ignoring them.   The resulting OSCE verdict, a masterfully acrobatic navigation of statements and reports that managed the least amount of honesty when it was most needed, rubber stamped an election widely described by experienced observer delegates at the time as perhaps the most sophisticated electoral fraud they'd ever witnessed.    The timing of the OSCE's abdication of its responsibility in Armenia in 1998 could not have been worse.  After years of preceding electoral manipulation, as a chance arose for democracy to change the course of a troubled country, the OSCE hailed a thorough fraud as a `step forward' for democracy, writing off the blatant joke of precincts reporting 300% turnout as not causing them `to question the result'.  The result in the years since has been the rapidly accelerating rot of Armenia's democracy.  The OSCE should be applauded for its honesty in 2003, but perhaps with a slow hand clap rather than a standing ovation.  Its talk this year is quite cheap.  For when it mattered most, when a credible international organization's verdict on the conduct of an election could have affected democratic processes for the better, the OSCE too often has blinked.  Elections in Armenia, Russia, Georgia, or the other former soviet republics, did not suddenly become `overwhelmingly distorted' overnight and in secret; they've been deteriorating predictably and in full view for more than a decade.  The OSCE's sudden, too little, and far too late honesty about electoral processes which are rotten to the core -  processes the OSCE itself has had a hand in perpetuating - might actually be comic if it weren't so tragic.  Georgia in 2004 may be different.  The OSCE did have an effect on the November election.  And if they are willing and able to stay as honest about the next one, Georgia may finally find the courage to not only refuse their legacy of electoral fraud, but work to eradicate it.It is likely, however, that the OSCE balancing act is in full swing already.  The likely next president, Mikhail Saakashvilli, is a friendly protégé of the OSCE member states.  He will likely win in a landslide, whether or not there is any fraud, and the OSCE will want nothing to taint his victory.  Clean reporting of electoral manipulation may already be taking a back seat to the rise of a friendly new ally in a difficult and unstable region.  Fraud there will certainly be.  It is tempting to think that the people power in Georgia that refused the latest fraud can herald a new interest in fair and clean processes, that somehow the disappearance of a corrupt figurehead will result in the disappearance of the deep rooted structure of electoral manipulation that kept him there.    But the practices of looking the other way while a ballot box is stuffed, or taking advantage of miserably inaccurate voter lists, forging a signature here or a vote total there, bribing or blackmailing voters with meager amounts of money that are many times their monthly salaries, have a way of sticking around and metastasizing into a permanent cancer if ignored for too long.  The OSCE will then have a choice between issuing a statement, the first draft of which is likely already written, that reports what actually happens, or one that will predictably refer to these practices as not having `affected the outcome', that despite these shortcomings, the result will have `reflected the will of the people'.  It is a crucial moment for the OSCE, an organization that appears to be attempting to rehabilitate its credibility.  Perhaps the OSCE will finally get the timing right.  For Georgia, though, much more is at stake than institutional credibility.  It will soon have a new president who will likely bring hope for a new future.  Whether or not his election will herald a new, freer democracy, is an open question."	m
I get to the end of my day and ask myself if I hit the PO!NT. It’s a brief time of reflection where I go over the days events and try to identify where my PO!NT met up with reality. I think today was a so-so day. I can see where I was onPO!NT, but I wasn’t in the game 100%. Tomorrow is a new day.  On another note; I think there has been some confusion about the title of my blog. I can clearly see why and where the confusion takes place. Most of you know that I run a growing marketing company called onPO!NT Media Group. O.K., Ameliou really runs it, I just add my 2 cents in on occasion.  Here is a little background.   OPMG came about as we were trying to identify a name for our new venture. If you have known me for a while, you may have heard me mention keeping an onPO!NT life. An onPO!NT life is a life lived with a PO!NT. It’s living with a purpose. It’s having your purpose written down and in front of you on a daily basis. Ameliou says it best: “If you’re not living onPO!NT, you are living with no point.” We used that correlation with our marketing company. We focus on finding and communicating the point you are trying to make. Why? Because if your marketing isn’t onPO!NT, it has no point.  Moving right along. My blog, as you can see, is hosted at OPMG. However, it’s meant to be a reflection of what my PO!NT is, and not a commentary on the happenings of OPMG. See how they are connected but not really?  I know… it’s confusing.  Anyway, that’s myPO!NT 42day.	m

Critics. Critics are the biggest group of snobs that I know. Why? Because they try to act like their opinions are unbiased and they simply are not. I can cite two specific examples: My Life by Bill Clinton and Fahrenheit 9/11. I want to state that I have my own political views and what I speak has not-so-much to do with party ties. I do not believe in the two party political system, which I am sure I will rant on about at another time. It has to deal with the fact that individuals use their own political beliefs to dictate whether or not something is 'good' or not.   Over and over on the news, on the web, and in newspapers I have had to hear how horrible Bill Clinton's book, My Life, is. Of course I had to go pick up my own copy and discover for myself. The book is not horrible. The book is not boring. The book is not a self-promoting tool thought up by Mr. Clinton himself.   The book goes through his life, which is perhaps why it is called MY LIFE, and documents important moments of his life. Some critics have said that they were disappointed by how little about Monica Lewinsky was in that book. I hate to disappoint people, especially those that are party whores and use their party ideology to justify every single belief that they have, or as I like to call them, Ba Ba Sheep, but Monica Lewinsky was not all of Clinton's life. He had a life before and a life after Monica. And there are over 15 pages devoted to Monica. Don't believe me? Go to your closest bookstore, look in the index and count them for yourself.   Most of the critics went into this book with preconceived notions on what it should be about, what tales should be written, and how the story should have unfolded. Sorry jerkies, this was HIS book, not yours.   Other idiots, like a few talk radio show hosts and cable news show personalities criticized the book on the first day that it came out, after admittedly only receiving a copy of the book that day. Hate to break it to you, but they did not read all 900 + pages of that book. They decided to thumb through it and base their biased, republican bought butts on a few chapters. Again, more jerkies.   Now let's move on to the Michael Moore film. I went and saw it because I was asked to write an unbiased review on the movie for publication. The movie was ok. Got people thinking. Wasn't lacking Michael Moore's dry humor during the commentary or his in-your-face-style. Wasn't his best work. I leave his best work to Roger and Me. But it was ok.    Now the backlash begins for Michael Moore, having to back up every statement that has been made, which if you are going to present a movie with a topic as serious as this, you better be prepared to. Do people, and by people I mean individuals paid to write about this movie, blindly miss the fact that this movie is going to be based upon his own opinions and will most definitely be biased towards that? Michael Moore has never apologized for himself or what he believes in. Why should this movie be any different.   And then there are idiots like Christopher Hitchens who debunk the movie. If anyone has read his column, it is more than obvious to anyone with two brain cells in their head working in harmony that this guy clearly does not like Michael Moore. And, while he is trying to debunk and prove with 'fact' the inaccuracies of Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 (which the 9/11 Commission, if being facutal in their reports, have already proven) he gets a few of these 'facts' he states wrong. Like that Iraq was the only country in that region celebrating what happened on that horrible day in September, almost three years ago. Iran, in fact, celebrated as well. Among others. His ranting and raving about Michael Moore is the same ranting and raving that republicans have done on websites like freerepublic.com or in various message boards and political chats. I am sure that I could find a transcript of Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh saying the same things that Christopher Hitchens did in his article.   What happened to unbiased reporting and truth in journalism? Now everyone has a vendetta or parties in their pockets, making them nothing more than literary whores. Cheap whores at that! And those literary whores do a great disservice to the writing community.	f
"On Friday the Senate passed the PIRATE Act, using a speedy method for passage usually reserved from noncontroversial bills.  The House still must vote on the PIRATE Act in order for it to become law.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for coming up with these laws.  Congress is attempting to pass the PIRATE Act in a quick and stealthy fashion, similar to how the the Judiciary Committee is attempting to get the INDUCE Act passed.  These are both very controversial bills and not a single hearing has been held for either of them.  A reason, one suspects, is because the senior members of the Judiciary committe get lots of donations from the entertainment industry: so far in 2004, Patrick Leahy has received $178,000 in campaign contributions from the entertainment industries, that's the second-biggest source of donations to Leahy behind lawyers.  Orrin Hatch has received $152,360.  These guys have definatly gone out for drinks with Jack Valenti after work.  To actually debate these bills would bring to light the Bill's many problems.  The RIAA and MPAA just want them passed, and quickly, before any press and critics get a say.   Foes of the Pirate Act have been alarmed by the unusual alacrity of the proposal's legislative progress. It was introduced just two months ago, on March 25, and not one hearing was held before the Judiciary committee forwarded it to the full Senate for a vote a month later.   For instance, the main change the PIRATE Act will make to US law is that it will allow the Gov't to go after file sharers in a similar fashion to the way the RIAA has been suing them by the hundreds, in civil suits.  Typically the Gov't, when going after criminals, file criminal charges against them.  Obviously their priorities are other than to prosecute teenage file sharers, considering the concern with such other criminal acts as murder, rape, terrorism, etc.  Believe it or not, the Justice Dept does have limited (taxpayer) resources and must pick it's priorities.   The Pirate Act represents the latest legislative priority for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and its allies, who collectively argue that dramatic action is necessary to prevent file-swapping networks from continuing to blossom in popularity.   They don't want any hearings because there would be some difficule and embarrassing questions:   ""I can't imagine that (Hollywood lobbyist) Jack Valenti or (RIAA chairman) Mitch Bainwol really wants to come before Congress and give testimony saying, 'We can't afford to bring these lawsuits. That's why we want the taxpayer to pay for them.' I can't believe they want to do that in public.""   Bonus for the entertainment industry, they get to use wiretaps now!   [T]he Justice Department likely would be able to seek wiretaps to collect evidence about P2P infringement. Current wiretap law says electronic communications may be intercepted when a potential federal felony is being investigated.   A basic problem with the PIRATE Act is that it forces the Justice Dept. to do the RIAAs job for it, using taxpayer money.  Should the Justice Dept spend a couple million bucks next year suing file sharers?  Sounds like a waste to me when the RIAA is doing a fine job already.  Also, if the INDUCE Act passes there will be no need to sue file sharers anyway, because there will no longer be any P2P networks or iPods around.   ""It represents yet another point in another very long line of major corporate copyright interests pushing for and receiving what amounts to significant corporate welfare,"" said Adam Eisgrau, a lobbyist for the P2P United trade association. ""This legislation literally offloads the cost of enforcing copyrights traditionally borne by the copyright holder onto the federal government and therefore the taxpayers.""

Go ahead and try to find an article that casts this bill in a positive light, I dare you (and no press releases from the RIAA, etc.)."	m
Had the weirdest dreams last night.  I was serving as an acolyte in a cathedral when I thought it best to get a quick shower before the service.  So I’m finishing up and at the sink brushing my teeth when I get this really strange, kind of creepy – kind of serene feeling that something or someone is about to reveal themselves to me.  Before I can grasp a second thought about it, St. John Maximovitch hobbles passed me and into the sanctuary!  This blows me away but in my dream I remember cognitively asking myself…”Hasn’t St. John of San Francisco reposed?  Then I realize how ridiculous this question really is when I become conscious that I’m standing in a towel, staring into a steamy mirror in the middle of the vestry!    Trippy to say the least…I say  weird dream( s )...the other I can’t really narrate the details to as I have small children…  Dinner last night with the Harley’s was brilliant as usual and not merely because of the Super Mex fish burritos.  Mrs. Harley gave us the state of affairs update regarding their fertilization struggles.  This is when ‘Is offered, as we had discussed a week or two prior, that she would offer her womb as a room for baby Harley!  Yeah my wife is a little bit special.  It was a very special kind of a moment where it’s hard to say anything but crying seems appropriate.  There was none of that but they were definitely touched…although I must say not nearly as much as I thought they would…probably due to the fact that they had already thought of the option!  Imagine that.  Oh well…MLS tonight!  It’s been two Saturdays in a row where we’ve missed Great Vespers on account of futbol.   “Lord have mercy.”  (3x)	m
The Darkness   Darkness drives toward me as in a car I ride.  Lights flicker and glimmer in the distant view.  The world once weighed so heavily.  The world once was the death of me.  I died everytime it got dark, and the day was my funeral.  I died in cars.  I died from fear of death.  I died from certain uncertainty.  The darkness drives toward me.  The intensity increases like a game of chicken.  Who will turn away?  Not I.  I proceed full throttle.  I love every minute of this for now I know life.  I exists more believably.  The darkness is not passing shadows of fear.  No longer am I afraid of the dark.  The intensity increases like the droning of a funeral dirge.  I love every minute more profoundly than the last.  Never again will I be afraid of the dark.  Never again will I dream of light shed.  The darkness may pass, but I'll wait til it comes back.  I'll wait.  Confident.  Relaxed.  The darkness has nothing on me.  The darker it gets outside the surer I am that there is life.  It brings me to a falling staircase.  It leads me down a flight of stairs.  It leads me to situations hopeless but with complete security that I'll land safely there.	m

My roommates, Jing and Mel and I, along with Jing’s cousins went to this bar in Timog called  Xaymaca  (it’s right across this gay bar called Gigolo-you can’t miss it unless they burn it out down and a different gay bar replaces the structure) to meet up with Jing’s cousin from Australia and his girlfriend to watch a reggae party where  urlLink Session Road  was playing.  The car ride was pretty boring. It was boring in the sense that I was two-dimensional.  Jing’s cousin Madel was a med student and Mel, of course, is a nurse so they had plenty to talk about, along with Madel’s classmate Jera who tagged along.  Jing and Raisa (who drove the car) talked about boyfriends and this Aga-Kristine chick flick “It Might Be You” (or was it “All My Life”? I don’t really give a shit), something a loveless bisexual like me cannot relate to. We arrived towards the end of the band’s first set but I got to hear them play  No Woman, No Cry, Jammin’, Waiting in Vain, King of Pain, Light My Fire , among others and some of their original songs.    I began to be bored again during intermission and was seriously contemplating going to Gweilos.  I texted Mario, the bar owner and Gweilos Hour host but he didn’t text back.  He was probably busy entertaining call center kids on a Thursday night.  I was also thinking of getting picked up. Too bad my black  “hot chick”  top failed to do the trick.  No one really gets picked up from a group; at least, that’s how I understand how the whole “picking up” thing works.  I don’t really go out much, sowee. But there were lots of beautiful people, I felt really sorry for myself that I wasn’t cute enough or that next to the med students I looked either fat or geeky (still don’t use contact lenses yet, can’t afford it) or old.  “Nope, I will not get laid tonight, poor me” , that’s how bored I felt.  I was already thinking of all the places I would rather be, I couldn’t really follow what they were talking about.  Not that I’m slow or anything, I just didn’t feel comfortable. I also thought there wasn’t gonna be a second set anymore.  Good thing I thought wrong.   A stand-up comic, Tuesday Vargas, was also there (I think she’s going out with the band’s guitarist). She sang and did the rap part of  urlLink No Doubt’s   Underneath It All  as they started the second set.  The “kids” stayed at the table outside the bar while Jing and I went back in and danced (or swayed, or gyrated, you pick the term. I just had fun; this was my type of music we were gyrating to). They also covered  urlLink 311’s  version of  urlLink The Cure’s   Love Song (Jing got a bit emotional especially when it got to the  part, ”However far away, I will always love you” ),   Santeria  by  urlLink Sublime ,  Should I Stay or Should I Go  by  urlLink The Clash ,  Dyer Maker , the  urlLink Sheryl Crow  version and a lot of other songs I can’t remember right now.  They also did some original songs but my favorite was  Suntok sa Buwan ,  which is also the design of the t-shirts they were selling. They ended their set with  Elevation  by  urlLink U2 .    we didn’t stay for the credits anymore, which is the best part about watching a live band perform after you’ve yelled and jumped all you can to their music.  I felt bad that I didn’t get to finish watching all the band members strut their stuff ‘coz the vocalist is always the last.  Hannah Romawac rocks!!!! I was falling in love with her and I wasn’t fucking able to get her to sign any of my law books. SHIT.  she connected with me  sobra ! I wanted to strangle myself with the braids of her hair.     at first i really felt bad about going.  i felt stupid for letting them drag my big neurotic ass there.  i usually go with my friends chris, beth or tina for gigs like that so i didn't expect to enjoy, but i did. i had such an adrenaline rush i kept saying that that feeling was better that sex.  maybe i'll let them drag my ass again next time  para ma-out of place uli sila sa'kin  :)	f

Remember that Calvin Klein underwear billboard?   The one that appeared in Times Square in 1982 and revolutionized the way underwear was marketed to men?  Remember the model in that ad?  Remember how hot he was?    He still is.  I met him this afternoon.  He's no rocket scientist, but he's pretty to look at.  After making myself feel relatively ugly, I got to audition dancers for the  urlLink chorus  Christmas show.  I’m choreographing a big disco number (Mrs. Claus and the elves singing “Don’t Leave Me This Way”) and a soft-shoe number called “Tapping Paper” that features -- yes -- huge rolls of wrapping paper cavorting in tap shoes all over the stage.  Then we had three hours of rehearsal.  Then I went to Las Mañanitas with Keith, Keith, Steve, Jim and Jeff. So instead of running the Chicago Marathon, I filled my day with retired underwear models, disco magic, show tunes and a gossipy dinner with friends.  I'll chalk it up as a success.	m
"A recent thought that keeps crossing my mind is whether works deemed particularly ""literary"" -- as opposed to your Grisham or Steele bestsellers -- are doomed to failure at times because of literature's reputation for being, in a word, pompous. However, today's rant is more about the dreamworld of distribution.  A quick browse of the New York Times bestseller list reveals a little bit more Dan Brown than I'd like to see. (Dan Brown, of course, wrote  The DaVinci Code , that book I love to hate, if you'd refer to recent posts.) Nice to see that what is, in my opinion, such a poorly written book could manage to launch his entire body of work into the public eye and make that man rich, rich, rich. My sarcasm is, of course, intended.   A friend of mine noted that the entire beginning of the aforementioned book really functions as a giant ad for ""prequel""  Angels and Demons . Anyone who loved his protagonist that much ought to save themselves a lot of time and go rent ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  At any rate, again, there are bright spots on the list -- page down past #20 and you'll find my previous recommendations,  Life of Pi  and  Middlesex . It's good to know but also interesting to note that those books are carried in bookstores with a limited selection of titles, like Books-A-Million. Maybe distribution -- and the sign proclaiming ""Summer Reading"" -- is everything; God knows it's a lot. It's still heartening to see, but on a recent cheapskate trip to Books-A-Million, as opposed to local dealer Olssen's or ubiquitous but satisfying Borders or Barnes  Noble, I couldn't find Eugenides' previous book,  Virgin Suicides , on the shelves. I would imagine tons of Dan Brown would have been easy to find of course.  Another bright spot? Tolstoy's classic,  Anna Karenina , has found its way back onto the bestseller lists. Go Leo! That's pretty awesome. Actually, thank you Oprah, for that one.  So anyway, getting great reading into people's hands may be as easy as distribution and information -- prime real estate in Books-A-Million or a plug from Oprah. (One day, maybe, the Internet will help as well, of course, but so far it seems the masses are still mostly downloading tunes or reading news, as opposed to frequenting lit mags.) Literary magazines in a store like BAM? Nor hardly. Scan those shelves and the closest you get is  The Atlantic  and  The New Yorker .   Nobody ever said being a writer -- and actually getting read -- is easy, that's for sure.  Thanks for reading,  LadyLitBlitzin"	f

"Whew. Where to begin? I loved New York, but I am glad to be home.   Wednesday  We really just walked and walked and walked. Through Times Square and the theater district. The lights of Times Square are amazing. Breathtaking. Shocking. Had dinner at the Java Shop, where I saw Chris Noth, a.k.a. Mr. Big from Sex in the City.   Thursday  Had breakfast at a deli before staking out our standing spot for the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. We ended up across from the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of the David Letterman Show. I loved the parade. The balloons and celebrities  just awesome! Had lunch at our hotel. A nice buffet, although their definition of traditional Thanksgiving dessert and mine were totally different. Bring on pumpkin pie. Pecan pie. Not flan or pink mousse!! That afternoon we walked over to Radio City Music Hall (we could see the marquee from our 42nd floor hotel room.) Wandered around Rockefeller Center. Watched the skaters, window shopped. Not much was open, but there were lots of people. Really enjoyed the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular. Walked down 5th avenue and wandered our way back to the hotel.   Friday  Hit the Today Show at 7 a.m.  Us and hundreds of others. They had already closed the tourist area, so we went into Dean and Deluca for a bagel  coffee. Can I just mention how awesome a real bagel is? Andres Bocelli was the Today Show featured singer, so we wandered out to hear him sing. Just as we did, they opened up a new section behind the stage, so we got in and eventually got right up to the stanchion (those around us werent interested in an opera singer). He gave me goosebumps. The camera man was right in our section and mom and I were on TV!!  Matt Lauer came around and shook hands with mom and I (o.k., o.k., and lots of other people too). Then Al Roker came by and I conversed with him about a recent Thanksgiving special he had on the Food Network. He stood near me and talked directly to me for a minute or so. Even so, I felt Matt was more personable and sincere (o.k., and better looking too). Katie was off.  We had a hop-on, hop-off tour with Grayline, so we caught the bus up to Central Park.  The leaves had just turned and were stunning. We just dont get ""color"" in Texas. Worked our way up to Strawberry Fields and the Imagine memorial. Sat for a while and just enjoyed the view. Then over to the Dakota (a pilgrimage for Linda) and back to Tavern on the Green for lunch. The food was really good and I see why the place is a popular tourist stop, but I must concede the chandeliers, wallpaper and other stuff border on gaudy.  After lunch we visited the Rose Planetarium. It was Lindas primary destination (next to the Lennon pilgrimage). It didnt do much for me since it is based on the Big Bang theory and I dont believe that is how the universe was created. Perhaps I should have been able to separate my beliefs and enjoyed the place, but I couldnt. We grabbed a quick snack before attempting a Night Lights Tour. Grayline underestimated the response and didnt have enough buses. Luckily we could come back, but many others couldnt. The crowd moved as close to a riot as I have ever seen.   Saturday  After breakfast, we hopped on the bus to Macys. We mostly browsed, but we each made it home with something from the Worlds Largest Store. The morning started foggy and drizzly, but cleared up by the time we left the store. Back on the tour bus to Soho, Greenwich Village, Canal Street, Chinatown before lunching at Taormina in Little Italy. Then to Battery Park and the Staten Island Ferry. I really wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, but it is closed, so the ferry is the closest you can get. I think I sang (softly of course) God Bless America and America the Beautiful the entire ride.  Finished up the day with the Night Light Tour. There are lots of lights in NYC. And not just in Times Square. I really enjoyed seeing the buildings lit up at night (from the top of a double decker bus  its really a nice perspective).    Sunday  After my Krispie Kreme donut, it was off to the uptown tour past Central Park and into Harlem. I must commend the tour guides. They were interesting, entertaining and very knowledgeable. Mom wanted to hit Rockefeller Center on last time, so we did that before lunch at Stage Deli (yummy!), where we saw Jerry Springer (oooh, ahhhh  whatever.)  Unfortunately the shuttle service insisted we get to the airport way too early. I know we could have fit another something or two into the day. The flights were bumpy and we were stuck at OHare for four hours. It was 2 a.m. when I got home. But we got home safe and sound.   So, beyond the play-by-play:   I wont travel with Linda and my mom again. Linda wanted to go like great guns and mom cant. I felt bad for her. She cried last night when I dropped her off because she felt like her slowness held us back. I never want her to feel that way. I want her to go and have fun and not worry about others. Her hip hurt a lot from the walking. I could see that she was struggling, but when I would ask it was always, Im fine.  I always forget between trips that Linda snores. I spent a lot of this trip very, very tired. I am not accustomed to sleeping with someone (not even my mom). Couple that with snoring and it was really hard on me. One morning I woke up crying I was so tired.  Me being tired doesnt make for a happy camper, which can make for tense moments. I need my eight hours!  Our hotel was in a prime location. I would recommend it. That and the tours. You can only read so much and pick up so many brochures. The tours were the perfect compliment to the trip.  The weather was awesome. Excluding the one morning, it was sunny and clear each day. Sunday it was even warm enough to forgo my jacket. It was really, really nice. The only time I felt cold was at the parade. My feet felt frozen solid, but it was worth it. Truly, we could not have ordered better weather.  The service was about what you expect it to be. Indifferent. Sometimes outright rude. The tourists were really nice (an amazing number from Texas  every day we met someone from the Lone Star state). I guess beyond waiters and sales clerks, we didn't have much interaction with many locals ... and that's too bad. I would have liked more. It's the reporter in me.   And finally.   We chose not to visit Ground Zero. While it seemed an important destination for most every tourist we spoke with, none of us wanted to see it. But you do. In the faces of the passers-by. At the fire stations (ladder houses). The memorials and pictures and flags are everywhere. It is on the news every day. In the stories of the tour guides. You can smell it in the air. We saw bits of the building remains from a distance. I dont think you need to see Ground Zero to feel it.  I'm glad we went. I will definitely go back some day. But I am glad to be home. Alone."	f
Thanksgiving was excellent and hardly marred at all by the ungodly carrolling of the penguins.  I threw a boot at two of them and made eye contact with Charles- he seemed to be somewhat embarrassed by the behavior of his new friends, but did not make any other moves to re-establish contact.  We ate oatmeal and brie and listened to  urlLink Alice's Restaurant  on the shortwave, as we have done every year for the past 200 years.  Then we danced.  Arthur is very graceful when drunk on ceremonial wine.  I slept fitfully.  My enemies uncomplainingly returned to their watch for the squid, it was quite noble of them and I am beginning to rethink their enemy status.	f
Today I heard a  rumor. Danielle Barber, the wife of a soldier station with Jesse, informed me that her husband was told that he, and a few other soldiers, were possibly going to be deployed earlier than the rest of the pack. When I told Jesse about this he said he hadn't heard anything about this but that there were tons of rumors going around right now. This could be good news if they get to come home 3 weeks earlier then the rest, however it could also be bad news as well. Danielle and I were planning to fly to Texas in March to spend a few days with our husbands and in fact I had even spend the day with her on Sunday, buying a few new clothes to wear for our trip, and a few lacey items as well. I know I shouldn't get my hopes up for anything involving this whole ordeal but the fact of the matter is that hope is all I really have. I hope that David (Danielle's husband), Jesse and the rest of those who might have to go early, don't have to leave without the rest of the unit, and that they all leave at the same time. I want to fly to Texas to see Jesse, I feel like it is something I need to do.   I feel like the ARMY is taking more then they give.	f

"Guys tell: What matters most   By Matthew Sakey        For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.   1. Tolerance This is often interpreted as ""sympathy to scheduling issues during football season,"" but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like â whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy â and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.   2. Compatibility with friends His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.   3. Honesty and decency Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.   4. Independence This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his ""space"" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.   5. Comprehension of differences Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose."	f

"i need some damn sleep. i of course had to work last night in which i was unable to get any sleep. when i was supposed to get relieved by the other crew i had to wait because they had some formation and me and this other guy had to stay back. well when they finally finished and i got to leave i was tole i had to stay back and go with the duty driver on some stupid errands. by the time we got the srupid humvv and a damn radio it was about 0830. i got to my tent around 0835 and thought that maybe i could make it to breakfast even though it ened at nine. i went to the restroom and upon returning to my tent was told i had to be in the rec tent to clean up at 0845. so much for breakfst.  once that was done i had to go drive with the duty driver to pick up the laundry and mail. that wasnt exactly a short drive. it took forever and boy was the ride bumpy. i got to see the lake though. wow from the distance i saw it at and from what little i saw it was nice. i got to look at the scnerey which consisted of you guessed it....sand. then we go to get the mail only to have to get a slap in the face since no one had a mail card. why didn't i think of that. by the time we unloaded the laundry back at the tents and stuff it was about 1100. i took a shower and straightened up my little amount of space. by the time i was done i decided to lay down finally around 1220. i ended up having to get up around 1245 to get dressed for lunch since i told strasle i would and because well i hadn't eaten a damn thing. now i'm here and it's about 1430. i'm so tired but if i sleep now i won't sleep tonight. i get to be up by 0900 tomorrow or a fun-filled day of filling sandbags on of course my ""day off"". how lucky huh. at least i'm doing good and keeping safe i guess that's all that matters. other then that i think i'll take it easy today maybe go read another book. in the what almost 3 weeks i've been here i've managed to read 2 books. i'll have read a whole library by the time i leave this place. oh well it helps pass the time. everyone take care and god bless. get some sleep also. well for me at least since i can't seem to be able to at the moment."	f
"V.D.: DELAYED REACTION   Valentine's Day has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Frankly, I'm a bit ambivalent about it.  Great for you if you had someone to call your Valentine but for me, well, it seems I've always been in between boyfriends on February 14th.  Today, a handful of people greeted me with,  ""So!  How was your Valentine's Day?""   (These were folks who don't really know me well; otherwise they wouldn't have asked.)  I dunno, it wasn't too bad... I awoke on Saturday with a hangover (don't ask), went to a gay marriage rights rally, then to an eye doctor appointment, then home for a nap.  I hung out with my friends Woody  Todd that evening (I swear, my gay friends have better romantic relationships than I), then half-watched ""Saturday Night Live"" until I crashed at midnight.  Pretty exciting life I lead, no?  I will admit that things could be worse... I have a new job and I think I like it.  I can't believe that there are no ""red flags"".  I'm actually being treated like a professional and not being micro-managed by my new employers.  It's a small group, and everyone does their own thing, coming together to get things done and looking to others to provide assistance and their expertise when needed.  (I know that someone at my company is probably reading my Blog, so of course I have nothing but  great things  to say, heh heh!)  Additionally, I don't get the sense that there are any prima donnas there.  I'm the Office Manager, dammit, and I have an OFFICE.  With a DOOR!  Life doesn't get any better than that (when I dream, I dream BIG!)  There's even the possibility that I'll make a trip to our home office in Calgary (Alberta, Canada) in the near future, and the prospect of travel excites me.  I need a change of scenery and soon!!  Oh, regarding Saturday's rally,  urlLink Todd  posted a nice, long excerpt about the event  urlLink here .  I should mention that my blog is not, and never will be, a forum for political or religious debate.  I make it a point not to comment on issues I'm not completely informed about.  I will note, however, that everyone deserves equal rights.  I don't know if gay marriage will truly ever fly in our conservative nation but I firmly agree that gay couples in long-term relationships should be entitled to the same benefits that married, heterosexual couples are.  Todd's partner Woody was interviewed by our local NBC affiliate and stated that he would like the comfort of knowing that if anything should ever happen to him that Todd would be taken care of.  These two Boyz are dear friends of mine and I will always support them and their partnership.  They taken me under their wing during very difficult times and for that, they have my undying appreciation and respect.  It's been a rough journey for these two, and enlightening for me, getting to know them and seeing the dynamics of their relationship.  Particularly for dear Woody, who suffers Todd's running commentary on the decor of the sets of television shows that they watch (""Arrested Development"" on FOX:  ""Oh, I just  hate  that ugly lamp!""   BBC's ""Coupling"" on PBS:  ""Oh Woody, that's a  Miro lithograph  on the wall!""   The evening news on NBC:   ""Oh Woody, I don't like when Sharon Wright wears red... it's so unflattering with her skin tone!"""	f

I am in this state of mind where I sense that I had been going back on track in life, but have now fallen off track again.  This time around, I'm not beating myself over the head in frustration due to my failure.  I am frustrated because there is so much of my old self that doesn't want to go away.  So, I sit, and ask God to graciously help me to change.  Then, I go do things differently.	m
Yeah, so it's been over a week since I updated, so here we go.  I've been on vacation all week and go back at 12:30am Tuesday morning.  After more talks with Artis last week, it's obvious things are not going to reinstate, and I think I'm learning to accept that.  Dan wants to, well, go out with me, but that's far too complicated, and I just don't think it's a smart choice to pursue that at all.  So, there I was, all single, not too worried about it, and then I started talking to my buddy Yumi, a guy who contacted me from Planetout.  For some reason, I was kinda hesitant to meet him... I have no idea why, but I was.  Eventually though, I forced myself to... I have to stop being so damned picky and just meet people, and I think meeting Yumi proved that to me.  What I found when I met him was a cute, sweet, goofy, fun guy.  I was actually quite struck by him, so I decided to meet him again.  So that's twice I drove 80 miles round-trip to see him, haha... I'm always the one driving, but I love my car anyway, so who cares.  Both times we had fun, walked around outside a bit, just hung out... ok, well last time we maybe did a teensy bit more than hang out, but yeah... at least it shows we're interested in each other in some way.  I just hope this isn't another one of those situations where someone makes out with me and then does a disappearing act... doesn't seem likely though as he's driving down to visit me tomorrow... can't wait!  It's not like I'm going ga-ga for him... I've done that enough times to know it doesn't do anyone any good, so I'm holding back a bit, yeah, but maybe this time it'll work.  I just wanna meet a decent guy for christ's sake!  Hopefully that's exactly what I've done this time.	m
It's been such a weird ass day. It started with my trudging off to my unfulfilling job. Let's stop there and expand, it's unfulfilling and I never wanted to be where I am in my occupation. what am I? A fucking drone. The other day, I believe it was the day before Valentine's day, I was making CB's card, when on the spur of the moment I painted a Hippy Bird, you know multicoloured, crazy nutty bird and I was really proud of the way I handled the watercolours even though I had problems, like for example I fucked up that puffy part of the bird where the legs met the body, colour wise I had added too much red and it looked really bloody you know, like uh, it had it's rags or something. But still it was a great drawing, I was looking at this great bird that I had created and I thought why am I not in that profession? Why am I not being artistic? What is wrong with me that I cannot just go forth with this passion for drawing and painting that I have? What am I so fucking afraid? Why can't I make time? Why is everything so hard? Why can't I juggle everything efficiently and with much more control? What's going on with fear? What is it? Let me find it and kill it and just exorcise it from my life.	f
"yesterday i got back from Camp Pike 'o4! omg it was sooooo fun! seriously everyone that went on Wilderness was a BLAST to be with and we all had such a good time! the ride to colorado was like 15 hours, and we all rode on the same bus. it was a long ride, but we always have fun just chillin. then the day we got to the camp, we got to stay in this cabin called ""jungfrau"", although none of us could figure out what that meant or who thought of calling a cabin that. and we discovered that there were a few mice in our cabin...not cool. but they were all downstairs, not where our beds were, so it was okay. then the next morning we go up early and went to Inspiration Point, which is this AMAZING spot that the whole camp climbs to, and we have our morning devotion. from Inspiration Point you cant see so many mountains, hills, trees, and the rest of camp. its simply gorgeous! then we headed out for our ""warm-up hike"" to St. Elmo's. (has anyone seen ""St. Elmo's Fire"", the movie, with demi moore? its so awesome!) St. Elmo's was a 6 mile hike, and we allfinishedsplendidly.then we went to pizza hut to getsome pizzzzzzza and then we played the tripping game, which was SO fun!then we headed to our campsight and pitched our tent, which SJ and i were experts at! and we slept there that night and met some boy scouts that said they were 16 when they OBVIOUSLY werent. the next morning we went white-water rafting for the whole day. that was seriously awesome! our raft guide's name was John Meyer, kinda like John Mayer, so we just called him John da Bomb. and there were rapids called ""the wall slammer"" and stuff like that. doesnt make you feel very confident, but thats okay, it was so fun! then. that night,we stayed at the same camp sight as the night before, and SJ gave pavey and courtney a ""present"" but i wont talk about that, you just had to be there. then the next morning we went to a bakery and got donuts, and spenser paid for me because my moneywas in the trailor (thanks spenser). then me, katy, catherine, SJ, and brittany went in search of a bathroom across the entire town of Buena Vista. finally we found one. and then we headed off to Mt. Massive with our HUGE @$$ backpacks on our backs. the hike was soooo long and it hurt everyones back SO much. when we got to our campsite in the middle of this gorgeous canyon like thing, we realized the hike was worth it. we were surrounded by peaks, and the canyon had these two lakes that was gorgeous, and FREEZING (according to the boys and katy, who all jumped in). we set up camp that night, and ate some chicken and rice (yum). the next day was the most strenuous, scary thing ive ever done...but i did it. we all did it. that day we summited Mt. Massive (the second tallest mt in colorado) by making our own trail up this almost 90 degree angled ridge. it was so slippery and hard, but when we got to the top it was gorgeous! then after we got to the top of the ridge, we summited the peak. then we made ANOTHER trail down...but this time we slid on our butts in SNOW most of the way down. our hands were freezing, our butts were wet, and someboys were bleeding from helping catch the girls when we got to the end of the snow patches and couldnt slow down...but we made it back down to camp with just a few minor injuries. we slept again that night in the tents, and woke up the next morning at like 9to spenser playing the guitar, which was nice. then we made our way back down the mountain with our huge packs on our backs. it went much faster than onthe way up. we got down and then went to K's for lunch, which was verrrrry good. and then we went to this resale shop to buy our clothes for the dance that night. i got this weird skirt that was all colors and had weird patterns, and this yellow shirt that had little bows on it that looked like baloons. then we got back to camp and FINALLY took showers...which felt SO good, you have no idea. and then we headed back to the chapel for our skits. everyones was boring, except ours, of course, rocked. then we got the dance started and it was so much fun! i danced with this little boy during a slow dance because John Bryan asked me to because the little guy was shy and wouldnt ask a girl to dance with him. it was fun. and then the dance ended and we went back to the lodge and since wilderness didnt get dinner, we made ourselves some PBJ's and hot chocolate. we got our packages that our parents sent us then, and mi madre sent me some chips, doritoes, queso, skittles, and PEACHIE O'S (spenser theyre allllllMINE)!!! then we went back to sleep (after everyone kept trying to kill all the little mice that were in our rooms...what did the mice ever do to us???? nothing! we shouldve just sent them outside). we went to inspiration point again, the next morning, and that was sweet. and then we went down for breakfast in the dining hall and then we packed and watched all the little kids get awards for climbing Pike's Peak, when wilderness didnt get ANYTHING for climbing the hardest thing EVER!! (jk im not bitter) then we took pictures of our whole group, and i know theyre gonna turn out great! then we finally headed back home on our huge buses, i slept alot, talked, read, and watched happy gilmore and bruce almighty.finally when we got back to church, i talked to lindsay chinn for a while and then mi padre took me and michael to get DONUTS! woot woot! then i got home, showered, and slept the rest of the day! PIKE WAS AWESOME!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS! COUNSELORS NEXT YEAR BABY!!"	f
"The night was just coming to life highlighting a moon crescent that was perfectly incomplete. There she was alone, standing on the edge of the shore, holding on to a half empty bottle of beer like it was a prop. She could hear the waves crashing in and out on the water while a myriad of diamonds bounce off foamy waves, sparkling in the moon glow for a split second only to get swept away by waves crashing at the shore.  Obviously, she was trying to ignore the maddening monotony of those sad songs that were being played on a nearby hut.  For a moment she was contented with the solitude but then out of the darkness, save for the lone moonlight; was him, watching her from a near distance. She noticed right away that he was walking towards her. She quickly returned her icy gaze back to the swaying waves.  “I—I’m---sorry—“ he managed to mumble.  She turned her head and met his gaze. “Try not to think about it.” Her voice trailed off into gasps.  And for him, it seemed to be something so easy to say. He meant well, she knew, but words meant little to a worried mind. He attempted nothing more however, and she was thankful for that at least. Kind words were enough on his part. He could do no more harm than that she thought.  “I know—that I’ve done you wrong,” he said  “Don’t try to think about it,” she said again.  There was a subtle resignation on her eyes, as if to say that it was ok to be unwanted, that it was ok to have nothing.  Her words lilting like music in his ears, a single sentence but the pitch, the lilts and the cadences, the nuances of pronunciation made him then realized how it felt good to hear her speak.  But softness lacked the weight of any true resolve.  “I heard that you’re leaving. I just can’t –""  “Can’t what? I’ve been patient with you for too long. It’s time I let go,” she said.  “And what do you suggest I do then?” He finally asked.  He did not expect an answer from her, nor did she fall short of his expectations. Though it would’ve been nice if she had, he thought. If only her kind words could whisk away his problems and maybe a few of her own.  “You’ll be fine without me.” She said softly.  “All along the little lies invade the spaces between our relationship. We seem to get buried with every crashing doubt. I sink every time you make a fool out of me. And I guess now’s just the right time to end this. ” She added.  She looked intently at the direction of the  Polaris  still holding the now half-full bottle of beer. He noticed that she seemed well that night, her eyes twinkling with the sparkle they had had long before they were lovers.  For a brief fraction of a moment, she felt a renewed sense of focus on her being. She felt like an early seafarer, searching for stars for answers.  “I must go home.” Her voice playing in the wind, telling him that all was right as it should be in the world. So she walked past him leaving him alone on the edge of the shore.  As for him, the thought still lingered like a sickness, seeping into the cracks of his mind. She felt it too, he knew, but  not thinking about it  was best left as merely kind words, and nothing more."	f

"Just when you blog negatively about your husband, he does something that warrants a serious blogapology.  James has been attending a Dale Carnegie class for the last 12 weeks.  He's mostly moaned and groaned about having to go and been less than enthusiastic about the fact that his employer required his attendance at the class but also  required  him to pay half of the $1400 pricetag.  But he still came home every Monday night talking about the people he was meeting and the stories they were telling.  If you've never heard of Dale Carnegie, it's a self-improvement course for learning how to communicate more effectively with others.  So anyway, in the last 12 weeks, James has stunned me several times with his newfound communication skills.  Like several weeks ago when I brought up renting office space.  We were having lunch together and the exact words out of his mouth were ""I admire and respect what you do.  I couldn't work out of the house; I'd get sidetracked watching ESPN all day.""  I wish I could have seen the look on my own face at those words, from the man whom I typically get what I want from, but not without a good prolonged knock-down, drag-out ""my way makes more sense"" kind of fight.    He is the conservative in our relationship.  He worries about the bills.  He has reservations about spending money to make it.  So that conversation that day at the Waffle House was a great milestone for him, because he continued to tell me he could see the value in renting office space and even though he would no doubt worry a little bit, he knew it is what I needed.  Wow.  But it gets better.  He wanted me and Rhonda (his twin sister) to come to his graduation session.  All of the class participants had to get up and talk about a defining incident from the class and their vision for their future.  All of them got up and spoke about what a difference a little communication skill had made in their personal and professional lives.  James got up and talked about a defining moment at work, where he realized the value of the principle of backing up what you say with evidence.  How if someone did a good job, tell them  why  you like what they did.  He said he felt he has always been good at showing support, but he has learned the value of telling people something uplifting to them, not just saying 'thanks'.     So, in the car on the way home, we got to talking about the class - all of the people, what he learned, what it all meant to him.  He had said in his talk that his point was if you love someone, tell them why.  If you like what someone's done, tell them why. He piqued my interest by saying he was going to talk about me, but at the last minute he didn't think he could without being too emotional.  (He is NOT an emotional kind of guy.)  I asked him to tell me, and he looked at me the way he did several years ago when we were dating - the look of 'I'm going to say something you might consider cheezy, and I'm embarassed to say it'.    We had gotten out of the car to pick the kids up and he gave me a great big hug and said, ""You always ask me how much I love you, not why I love you. You're my rock.  My everything.  You gave me two beautiful kids.  You're my reason."" (I'm crying!!)   Now, I have known for years that my husband's love language is in the way he takes care of me and the kids.  It's how he jokes with me and how he acts like I'm driving him crazy.  It's how he usually tells other people nice things about me more than he really tells me nice things.  There's never been a doubt in my mind that he loves me.  Every once in a while, he'll say something and catch me completely off-guard.  But he has never, ever, in 8 years, told me  why  he loves me.  It occurred to me that I never really had a need to know 'why', but hearing him say those words was like standing in my very own chick-flick, starring me.    I suppose I may never hear him open up like that again, and that's okay.  It wouldn't mean as much to me if he said things like that every day.  So I guess I should thank good ol' Dale Carnegie for teaching my husband how to say the things that matter."	f

Today I had suffered alot. Not only on what that I've done, also to that of how my dear bestfriend had treated me. It's very very painful when he gets up to this kinda behavious. It's really very unreasonable. Can't imagine that he even swear and curse at me. Was I that of harm to him? I still don't understand. It looks like he hates me alot. It's of no reason to behave in such a manner. Not only that of how he was, he also said the most heart breaking sentence that he'd not want to talk to me anymore. Isn't it so painful when you've thrown in all that effort and suddenly it comes to an end like this. Don't one would feel all used and of in great pain when such a thing happens? Why can't he think of how I've suffered and not think for others? Why can't he just spare few moments thinking of my pain? Isit that I'm of worthless to him? No one understands why it ends in such behaviour. Because when that thing happened in the morning, he was behaving as normally as possible. Smiling, laughting and joking away. Now thats of great pain to any human being.	m

"Hey- one more thing that I meant to ask before  forgot.  Have you all heard the soundtrack to ""Great Expectations""?  There's a couple on there I'm not crazy about but I love most of the CD- I've been listening to that a lot lately.  Another (not too common artist) that's pretty good is Rufus Wainwright (his second CD ""Poses"" is better than his first, I think).  He had a song on the ""Shrek"" soundtrack (""Hallelujah"") and also on the ""Moulon Rouge"" soundtrack- that one escapes me right now, but it's also good.  Both of these just kinda fit the mood I'm in- some of the inspiration I've gotten the last couple of days have come from the ""Great Expectations"" soundtrack songs."	f
blah blah blah!	f
I honestly think I'm bipolar.  I'm happy for one moment and then quite sad and depressed the next, usually I rarely show that latter, but today, I think I was pissed off a lot and it showed.  Today was really uneventful, but I was pissed off at my stupidity in math, pissed off at my stupidity in chemistry, and pissed off of the stupidity of Ramy.  My god, stupid kid, stfu.   I always end up forgetting to do things that I really wanted to do, and afterwards, wallow in a sad state, it's quite retarded of me, maybe if I had more initiative.  I really wanted to comment on Ruth's necklace.. I think it was new, maybe it wasn't, heck, it looked good on her, I could have said that at least.  Now, it's passed, and I can't do anything about it, except say the same thing tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Tomorrow.  In retrospect, it isn't as important as I usually make it.  I take almost every moment of my life seriously, as if it was my last.  I guess that's a bad way to live, but whatever, I think it makes sense, what if I get shot suddenly... Meh, whatever, too much thinking, not enough doing.  Maybe it's the weather, I tend to get more pissed off as the amount of sunlight decreases.  There's a name for it, I can't think of it right now, maybe I'll get to it at some other point.  Also, I'm really itching to fight someone.  Really.  A can of woopass to be unleashed.  I think it's bad, but I really really really want to break something over someone's head right now.    I'm not actually as crazy as this all might seem, I just get mad at a lot of stupid things.  It'll go away, like always.   Oh, and my wrist is like broken, it doesn't bend certain ways.  sigh...  Highschool really seems pointless to me now.  Last year, I always thought I was learning for a greater purpose, to get a little closer to The Truth, but in reality, I think learning all these things makes it just a little worse.

"Just think of what else we could be using 50 billion dollars for...   US military cost in Iraq, Afghanistan to exceed $50 billion next year: official     www.chinaview.cn 2004-05-14 08:38:56         WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhuanet) -- US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost over 50 billion US dollars next year, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Thursday.       The administration would make the next request for money to fund US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan early next year, which ""will surely be much larger than 25 billion"" dollars, Wolfowitz told senators at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.       The White House formally proposed a request last week for 25 billion dollars for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next financial year that begins on Oct. 1, because of the growing cost of US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.       White House budget chief Joshua Bolten said earlier this year that the military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan would probably be 50 billion dollars for the next year.       The war spending is not included in the 402 billion dollars theWhite House has proposed for the Defense Department for 2005. Enditem"	m

"It all started at...David's house. I saw him...PLAYING A GAME! I quickly took a snapshot as proof, then went to the police station. I showed them the photo, and they said something I've heard one too many times. They said,""You're crazy."" I was utterly shocked, to say the most. But then...the police officer ripped off a mask showing that he was...a Republican. You don't want to run into them into dark alley. Fortunately, I was in the police station, not in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it was dark in the police station that wasn't a dark alley. So I say to him ""Look! Yet another Middle-Eastern Country to blow to bits and make them free but really under our control!"" and I point behind him. Being a Republican, he fell for it. I ran. It was bad, to say the most. But I was desperate. I needed to find an authority. I ran into a Janitor. He asked me if a toilet backed up. I told him that the Republican in the police station was after me, and that he needed a push to the right. Unfortunately, he was a Leftist. He jumped me. I couldn't stop him. He took out a knife conveniently hidden in the toilet. I kicked him, and fled. That made two evil people after me. Then, I met the worst person I could ever meet in person who I knew was evil. Al Gore. He said,""Are you okay? Y'know, I invented being okay!"" I ran...again. I was shot by a random person, and died. The Beginning."	f

"CNN has  urlLink more  on the recently filed lawsuit over ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" song (Ah-weem-a-way Ah-weem-a-way).  The family of the woman who wrote the song appears to be relying on moral rights laws to claim that they still own the song despite the fact that the writer sold it.     The song, popularized in the long-running theater production and cartoon movie ""The Lion King"" was originally written in 1939 by Solomon Linda, a Zulu migrant worker turned songwriter.  The writer died penniless in 1962.  Her family now lives in poverty in the infamous Soweto neighborhood in Johannesburg.     The song has been covered by at least 150 artists, including The Tokens, George Michael, Miriam Makeba and The Spinners.  Linda's three surviving daughters and 10 grandchildren, living in poverty in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, have received only a one-time payment of $15,000.  When you consider the condition of the family, you sort of hope Disney will just take a small hit and settle.

"Living in Texas all my life, you'd think I'd have come to terms with summer by now. Well, I haven't. I still dread it every year, 'cause I know it's gonna be  urlLink miserable . My friend Derik and I have an ongoing morbid joke about how it's not officially summer in Texas until somebody leaves their baby in the car. If only  urlLink George Foreman  designed cars. I know, it's sad, it's horrible, it's reality. And it happens E V E R Y single year. Last year alone, 95 such deaths happened nationwide, 530 since 1998. It's like some sort of barometer for stupidity. Derik's philosophy is that it's some sort of intentional genetic candle snuffer, since a suspiciously overwhelming majority of the children just  happen  to be mentally/physically handicapped. It's like the parents' way of ridding themselves of life's lil' speedbump. Some people just weren't meant to be parents.  Well, this year the state of Texas is instigating a new campaign that reminds people not to leave their baby in their car. It's called the ""Look before you leave"" campaign. Just another ridiculous waste of money and resources. I can't believe that people have to be taught how NOT to kill their child. Over the years I see more and more absentee parents. People don't discipline their children anymore.   Here's a prime example of the kind of morons passing themselves off as ""parents,"" that I come in contact with on a regular basis. I was at the grocery store the other day, in line at the check out, 4 people deep. I rubberneck ahead to see what the holdup is: Is the checker using an abacus? Is the sacker on his cellphone again? Is another dumbass waiting until they've watched ever item scan, before they start writing their goddamn check? Or is some old coot rummaging to the bottom of their fuckin' coin purse/pockets for exact change again? What?! WHAT?! No, it's none of these things. It's a woman, holding up her 4 year old, letting her scan her goddamn groceries! 'Cause "" she likes to. "" This at peak shopping hours. I fucking kid you not. I'm lookin' around for the Candid Camera crew. I could not believe it. I'd like to sail lil' Hailey's spoiled ass right across that fuckin' scanner and into a brick wall, like a goddamn air hockey puck! Man! Parents are retarded!  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. From tantrums that end in ""rewards"" for stopping, to ""time outs"" that have all the effectiveness of a  urlLink Whiffle  brand diaphragm. Today's parents feel compelled to take their kids with them EVERYWHERE. Whatever happened to  urlLink baby-sitters ? Whatever happened to  urlLink discipline ? Whatever happened to parenting? Fuck this ""Dr."" Phil psychobabble about damaging their delicate lil' psyche. Children must have discipline, or face my wrath (Khan has nuthin' on me...and I don't mean Chaka).

"ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS' LABYRINTH  - take time to visit the Labyrinth in the courtyard near the parish Center.       The design of St. Michael's Labyrinth is modeled after the one located in the floor at Chartres Cathedral near Paris, France.  The Labyrinth at Chartres was built around 1200 and is laid into the floor in a style sometimes referred to as a pavement maze and is walked as a pilgrimage and/or for repentance.  As a pilgrimage, it was a questing, searching journey with the hope of becoming closer to God.  When used for repentance, the pilgrims would walk on their knees.  Sometimes this eleven-circuit Labyrinth would serve as a substitute for an actual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and as a result, came to be called the ""Chemin de Jerusalem"" or Road of Jerusalem.       In walking the Labyrinth, the walker meanders through each of the four quadrants several times before reaching the goal.  An expectancy is created as to when the center will be reached.  At the center is a rosette design which has a rich symbolic value including that of enlightenment.  This is where the individual is invited to mediate.  You will notice the four arms of the cross are readily visible which provides significant Christian symbolism and also includes a Baptismal pool.       Come walk the Labyrinth--come experience a  walking meditation -- every Monday morning starting at 8:00 AM with Fr. John Smith.    A NEW TESTAMENT GREEK CLASS FOR LAY PEOPLE  to continues every Wednesday at 8:45 AM in the Parish Center.  Fr. Smith will be teaching an Inductive approach to the Gospel of John.  There is a $35 workbook fee for this class.  For those interested, please call the church office at 886-7292 or email to church@stmichael.net   YOUNG ADULT BIBLE STUDY AND POTLUCK  continues Wednesday evenings at 6:30 PM following Evening Prayer.

"Migrain is finally gone and all is good and well inside the head of our famous, little character Frances. Chilling to some Duke Ellington she smiles and wonders about that person who she wonders about when she wonders. Or about wondering about wondering, one or the other or both. Apart from the ocassionally reply from MSN buddies she is undisturbed. Reading though her resume again, seeing if she should add more or take somethings out. Laughing at the fact she had to put her gender because of her name, she coasts through the rest and places it down.  ""Those Bakers Delight people better love me, if not I shall become a Brumby's gal and there shall be a baker's war in which I throw my first attempt of bread at their heads."" she thinks to herself. ""Then no one will be able to stop the rath of ME! moohahaha!""  Focusing off her world domination plan she continues to wonder about that person she wonders about when she wonders. Or about how stupid she was to give Pete her answers as Alex is in a bad situation without any at all.  ""Great! Why do I always help the annoying ones and let my friends down"" she proclaims annoyed at herself. ""If I hadn't had a migraine I would of been able to get the questions back off Pete and give them to Alex. DAMN YOU MIGRAINS"" she cries shaking fist in the air. She cools herself down by turning up Ella Fitzgerald's and Louis Armstrong's  'Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'  and she starts to sing... ""So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,  I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas, For we know we need each other so we, Better call the whole thing off, Let's call the whole thing off."" She breathes a sigh of releif and continues to wonder about that person she wonders about when she wonders. Or at her terrible history outcome. How could it come to this? A fail? Frances Hatcher of B plus ville? The one given the highest expectations as if she would succeed? No wonder why she always lets people down. She remembers a time when this was not so. She was a bossy, arrogant, stuck up, know-it-all, little grade 4er who treated her friends like second grade poop. She runs her fingers through her hair and sighs again. ""Guess I'll never know"" she says, quite out of the subject. Maybe she was wondering about that person she wonders about when she wonders after all."	f
"urlLink Bloomberg.com: : ""In a 2002 referendum, 99 percent of Gibraltar's 20,683 registered voters chose to reject any plan of shared sovereignty of the territory between Spain and the U.K. The Spanish and British governments said the referendum had no legal merit. Spanish exports to Gibraltar last year totaled 420.3 million euros ($505 million), and imports from the territory amounted to 1.7 million euros, according to Spain's chamber of commerce.""  By those numbers, it looks like Gibraltar is a cash cow for Spain, and that nobody there wants to live in Spain.

"Today was fun hanging out with Mom, Jason, Shayna and Ben. We headed out late morning to Best Buy and then the big mall. I don't think I've spent that much time at a mall....ever! I'm not really a big mall person. I only bought 2 things - a shirt for Ked that hopefully will fit and a cool necklace that I found on clearance for $.97. If anyone is going to find the bargain it will be me! By the time we got home I was exhausted! I fell asleep in the car on the way home, then again before dinner, and then again in the recliner after dinner. So why am I still up??? It was fun and I tell you, my brother is hilarious!! He's full of quick and silly quips and he had us in stitches after dinner.  I chatted with the SupaK this evening. During those chats it almost seems as if we're not 1,200 miles apart. Although at times they remind us of that painful year we dated long distance... big phone bills and long goodbyes!! At least now we have free mobile to mobile minutes. Only 4 more days and we'll be together again!  I'll try to download the week at Elk Lake, but it seems to be the consensus among the Elk Lake bloggers that it just might be impossible to ever convey what took place up there. God was there and He moved. Otherwise the activities included seeing Saved! (which created very interesting discussion and a funny skit for skit night), a viewing of Spiderman 2 which totally rocks, dinner at Mongolian BBQ where we all ate too much and the waitstaff and grillers gave us lots of attention in many various forms! Campfires, smores, hobo pies, freshman guys taking ""baths"" in the lake in the mornings (poor lake!), hemp necklaces, henna tattoos, Switchfoot in the mornings, and many experiences in the kitchen and over the charcoal grill (which I must say my gals did 10 times better grilling than the guys!). But the heart of the trip lay in the discussions in the living room and in cell groups, pouring over Ephesians, discussing community, surrounding each other, bearing each others burdens, breaking through barriers and bondages, and encouraging and praying for each other. When God shows up it's hard to explain in words what happens. We can describe activities but it is hard to explain the activity of the heart and soul. How do you explain developing a love for a group of ladies that can only come from God? How do you explain seeing their hearts open and how they grow? All I can say is that there is a group of students that are extremely special to me, and I am so excited to see where God takes them and how they follow His leading as they move through high school and into adulthood. They've been ""dared to move"" and they are moving."	f
Hi.  I'm feeling incredibly depressed right now, to the point of tears.  I don't know exactly where it's coming from.  Perhaps that we're into the new year and I don't have a clear vision for what I want to accomplish.  Part of me doesn't want to go through with it at all - just stay where I am (as though that would really make me feel better).  I don't know.  I am prone to depression, and I take medicine to help alleviate it.  I took my meds about 15 minutes ago, so I'm waiting for them to kick in.  You know, when a depressive episode kicks in, I really hate that I have it.  It feels frustrating, as though I'm out of control of what's going on.  I just look forward to it passing.	m
Naps are few and far between for me. In high school, I was convinced that we should have nap time like all the kindergarteners have. Not fair. Many times I have gone out to my car during my hour break at work to try and take a nap. It's too hot to do that now, but it was good while it lasted. It's not that I don't get enough sleep at night because normally I do. I think it's just that I need a 20 minute power nap to get me refreshed. I rarely get naps now. I came home from work early today because I wasn't feel well and I took a 4 1/2 hour nap! That's craziness! I have just been exhausted lated. Not sure what that is related to. It was good while it lasted though...	f
"[as posted at  urlLink Green Boogers ]   In the last couple of days I've come to realise that I've put my life on hold for a reason that is completely ludicrous, and at the same time, horribly sad. I don't know how to say it so that it doesn't sound theatrical, so I'll just come right out and say it: I've stopped living my life because I'm too fat. By ""not living"" I mean that I don't like to meet new people; I don't like to shop for clothes; I'm hesitant to join sport-related outings; I'm not willing to look for a new job because I don't want to go to an interview as a fat person.   It's easy to give up on diets and exercise regimes and say  ""who cares if I'm fat; it's my body and my life, and I want to enjoy it""  - but sadly the answer to the rhetorical question is that  I care . I  do  care. I don't care what other people think about my lifestyle, my clothes, my hair or my personality, I don't even care if they think I'm overweight - but in a my logic, I think that people see me as I see me, and I know I don't like what I see; why would anyone else? No amount of opposing evidence is likely to change my mind.  I don't think being fat makes you a bad person. But as always special rules have always been in effect for me, so I think that being fat makes  me  a bad person.   Having realised, or admitting to - I really can't tell - the facts doesn't mean that I've actually changed in any way, or that I ever will; great dramatic scenes only have entertainment value and have little to do with my actual motivation. I've learned that I don't actually mind embarrassing myself nor eating my words, as it were, in public. However, at the moment I feel that I'm ready to move on and get a hold on my life again. I can't fix how I feel about myself  [that's probably a lifelong job for a really good shrink] , but I can try to change myself from the outside. Building up from the human wreck I am now  will  be unpleasant, discouraging and slow, and I can't promise that I will stick to it... In case of failure, I will eventually try again, and again. A lot of people spend their whole lives doing this, I hope I'm not one of them.  Damn, I don't mean to be dramatic.  It's just new to me to have energy to even think about improving my life and feeling like I need to get on top of things - who would have known? Leaving work at normal hours, not logging on to work from home and not doing overtime has actually paid off."	f

So...our dear friends Chad and Jenny from AZ came out to visit us this weekend. It was quite a breath of fresh air for both Leah and myself.  It was fun to see some old familiar faces and just relax with them. Well...we didn't really relax, but we did to lots of stuff together.  They came out on Saturday, and right away we ate, and then went to buy more food for a bar-b-q with the Cronins and the Pearsons and some other friends at the CC Youth House. Then from there, after many games of Halo, we went to the Angels game. They got worked by the Dodgers and we sat it the furthest seats from home plate. That sorta stunk. After the game, we were itching for more Halo and burgers, so we went to the youth house again. We bought some fireworks, and since I'd like to keep my job, we set em off in an industrial park a few yards from the church.  Right as the last firework was going off, a cop rolled in.  As soon as we saw the cop my mind raced to the worst possible scenario. I'd be sent to jail, fired from my job all that stuff. But I stood still. My first inclination was to run, but that's pretty juvenile.  As Im freaked out and wondering what to do, Chad Cronin is slipping behind or into the car, thinking that will save him. It was funny.  The rest of us stood still as the fire work was still going off as the cop was trying to roll up on us. It seemed like that firework just kept going and going and going.   Anyhoothe cop rolled up, and all he said was (imagine this in your meanest, toughest cop voice) clean up your trash.    Thats all he said and did. He rolled out of there, and I about did a back flip. It was awesome!  On Sunday, we went to Church, saw the CC big ol' American flag and listened to Dr. Schuller do some horrible acrostic to A.M.E.R.I.C.A. yuk. But after that nightmare was over, we wanted to take Chad and Jenny to see our new favorite movie, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE! (seriously...this is my new favorite movie; every like is like a gift from God)  Ok...I'll speed it up, Sunday night, the night of the fourth; we couldnt find a good place to see fireworks. But Leah and I had a crazy idea of trying to park near Angels stadium and watch their 4th of July show. And by the grace of God we turned into a hotel parking lot that had the best view of the fireworks.  It was great.  Monday, we had some breakfast in old town Orange, and they took off for home.   NowIm sick.  I was probably sick on Saturday, I just amped myself through it. I feel like walking around my office in a big warm blanket. Thats how good I feel.    OkBye.	f

Yesterday, the long version...   I snuck out of the house around noon and Adri and Steven came and picked me up. We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the ˝-1˝ miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)	m
urlLink Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  I was struck by the trailer for a new movie at the theatre yesterday (at the  urlLink Uptown theatre  no doubt)which is a perfect setting for this stylized period film that I can't wait to see. Gweneth and planes haven't mixed too well in the past. But the black/brown  and art deco look of the trailer ensure that this will be a visual treat reminiscent in look to the classic, Metropolis. -NW	f
"""Three in three days."" I looked up from my iced tea. ""three what?"" ""you know, three different guys in three days. that was my weekend, in a nutshell."" ""you're kidding."" ""nope..."" ""dude, that's just wrong. and stop grinning like that. it makes me feel dirty."" I could only hold his gaze for about three seconds before I looked away and laughed.   wow, he's been a busy bunny rabbit. I'm not going to embarass anyone and name names. he knows I'm strangely impressed by the whole thing because my slut phase never really ever happened...I just had a short spurt every now and then. though lately, I'm beginning to wonder if that might be changing. can't say how...or when...or why.  long weekend from my end, too. two parties, practice (while hungover) with the boys, another party and a movie with the birthday girl...too much. slow down, I think I want to get off. about now all I can handle is some toon tv. tomorrow, back to the treadmills and the job hunt. rather carefree living, I suppose. I'm reading the Tao of Physics in the hope of coming up with ideas for a promise I made to Bianka. there's a snowball's chance in hell that it could actually happen, but it never hurts to try. ;)  the fortune cookies are broken. decided to treat mom to chinese dinner and we both got the same fortune about an inheritance. sure would be nice if that were true, but you know I'm not holding my breath. life has a funny way of reminding us what we don't have...regularly. no, it's not a square deal, but what other deal is there? if anything, it keeps us focused on our dreams.   and island off the coast of Western Australia is for sale. for a modest fee, one could build their own paradise, perhaps soverign. friends always welcome, enemies would never know where to find us. solar power, of course...desalination for water, a little satellite communications and we're good to go. and you're an hour from Sydney by boat. sounds  like a fine arrangement to me..."	m

my big gay life (2)    I have decided that my next boyfriend should know absolutely nothing about the internet, computers or chat rooms. I think, in some ways, the internet allows for artificial intimacy. Words are powerful. People say things they might not say in person. The internet enables a superficial closeness, so by the time you get to actual physical intimacy, no one knows what they're doing. Except me, of course, because I am smart, funny and handsome. So, will my next boyfriend be Amish? Hard to say. I'm not big into no electricity, churning butter or waking at the butt-crack of dawn. Where is that technologically-hopeless man of mine? I know he must be out there.	m

I am SUCH an idiot.  So when you really like someone a lot, and you have an incredible friendship, and things seem like they're on a fast track to where you want them to be, the best step to proceed to is definitely:  a) Keep things the way they are, keep spending time together, and hope that you get some clear sign as to how to proceed; b) Make a move, hope it's received well; c) Get drunk and sleep together.  Again, I'm a complete idiot.  Conventional wisdom is completely lost on me, apparently.  Things were going SO well... I had even decided not to rush things, to believe that if they were going to happen, they were going to happen.  I'd actually reached a point where I felt it was inevitable, and so I was even MORE okay with holding off.  A date here, a date there... maybe soon we'd be dating legitimately, and wouldn't that be nice?  Then I got a phone call at 2:30am, which was innocent enough.  Then I made it something it wasn't, and though it was something I wanted to happen, that's not how I wanted it to happen.  We both deserve better, we deserve to have things happen under circumstances where we both know exactly what's happening and the consequences.  I'm afraid that she thinks I've lost some amount of respect for her, and I'm terrified that she's lost some for me.  I'm not safe anymore.  Fuck.  She's not to blame for this, and I'm not entirely to blame, either.  I'm not a bad person, and I think that if I'd not been drinking, I would have showed more respect for both of us, and stopped things at innocent making out.  I'm so scared right now that it's never going to be the same.  So, so scared.  V, could use your help right now.	m
"Economy |  ""So often we rob tomorrow's memories by today's economies.""  -- John Mason Brown"	m
at our community pool, i’ve seen a couple come and go with their little baby and all the baby accessories. once we left at the same time, so we waved goodbye andi saw them pack everything into their blue SUV-thingie. every timei drive by and see that blue SUV-thingie,i smile thinking of them swimming with their baby and carrying more than people without babies carry when going to the pool for the afternoon.    nearly every morning around 10AM, a guy swims with his two dogs on the other side of the lake.i can’t see him very well, so can’t guess his age andi don’t know who he is, but i’ve come to hope he and his dogs will be there wheneveri realize it’s that time of day. one dog is white and the other yellow (labs perhaps), and they love splashing and swimming around the guy – the water goes a-flying. he tosses a stick and they all swim out toward it as if racing and laughing together.i like that guy whoever he is; somehow he makes my day better than it was at 9:45.    i know at least three friends who work in offices and read my blog, andi can picture each of them in their little spaces, working on the work they do (hello, hello!).i like picturing them there; it comforts me to see them even when they’re far away or we haven’t spoken in a while.    oncei had a friend with a little photo of himself in his cubicle with pin pricks in it, he liked to throw pencilsi guess. he said, “me, the target. buti don’t feel that way any more.” he pulled it down and tossed it away.i always meant to ask him about that, and wish i’d kept the picture – even if it was a really bad photo of him.    maybe my friends in their offices are having a bad day today. maybe their bosses are making them crazy. maybe the library members, subcontractors, and authors are being demanding. maybe today rather stinks in their life. maybe that guy with his dogs has only one good half hour in the day, or maybe one dayi won’t see him again. maybe my old friend feels like a target again. and still, somehow, both stranger and friend make my life richer just picturing them, wondering about them, praying for them, imagining their routine, thanking them for what they’ve given me, and even missing them terribly.    my youngest son’s question keeps coming at me, “what is your greatest heart’s desire?”i can come up with some pretty good-sounding spiritual answers – andi even mean them. but then there’s my earthly answers, and self-sacrificing ones,the selfish, the horribly honest, and then my wonderfully honest answers, and i’ve just decided thati must have several hearts for all the desires within them.    how can it possibly be this hard to live here on planet earth? seems the older i get, the more complicated it becomes, and the lessmost of ussee things as black and whitebut instead understand there are many layers and depths beyond our easy glance. we understand better how people do the things they do, even if we don’t agree with them or ever want to walk such paths or just don't have such affinities. but we get it. we can see a hint of waywardness within ourselves or our own secret wishes and it heightens our compassion and understanding. maybe that’s why. maybe discovering deeper levels of compassion inside, desired needsof forgiveness, more substantial beauty in what we’d once pass on by – maybe that’s why it’s hard on ole planet earth.    i don’t know. i’m just thinking here.	f
Wow.  Two posts in one day.  This will never happen again.  Isn't it amazing how things can change totally the other way round and when a day starts of bad it can end up good.  I made friends with them (elephant juice), I'm allowed to go to Leeds fest.  No news on the house, and Joss is going as of tomorrow (fingers crossed).  And Im happy.  I finished my work.  I played a game today hah yea im sad, where you have to name all the things you love.  I love my friends who tell me what is right instead of what I want to hear.  I love potential adventures and I love people who demand me to be my best because they know I can do better things than what I am doing.  Mainly, I love my friends... in a friendship way :P:P:P	f

Well, yesterday after school I whent to Jen's, had some awesome roast beef layered on top of white rice, mmmmm. Um, other than that I have nothing else to talk about...I'm kinda boreing today. Sorry. Well, you should all go, look up Mars Volta, and download all of their songs. Bye kids.	m
Last night Jen and I were suppose to go meet some friends for a birthday party at Lush 1520 Greenville Ave., Dallas. I hate that place I will NEVEREVER go back and be humiliated like that again. We stood out side for about 30 minutes the friend we were meeting came outside to try and get us in and could not. I would never recommend anyone to go there to stand in line and feel crappy the way I did tonight. So we went up the street another bar and called the people that we were going to be meeting. They said we'll be down there in a little bit well an hour passed and there was no sign. I called him to find out where he was and got no answer on the cell so I text messaged him got no response.After about another hour or sowe decided it wastime to leave. So I call my friend that's still at the party to let him know that we are going, I get no answer. As the night goes on I called 30 minutes after the bars close and get no answer. I'm hating life right about now. Rejected because I don't look the part to get into the club and rejected by the boy that we were suppose to meeting. I know it wasn't his fault that we couldn't get in and it was his friend's party, so I could never really ask him to leave. I just wish that life wouldn't be so hard.	f
"Well it's been quite awhile since an update.  But I have not forgotten!  Let's start with today.  We finally got to putting together our presentation, we presented the play that I wrote, I spoke on the Roman Gods for ten minutes straight--it was a very boring lecture--but, anyway, Jarrod proceeded to do his Sean Connery impression while reading the lines for Jupiter (many, if not all of which, were written seriously).  I think he got a little carried away, he made a few connery-esque jokes during various monologues, and it kinda pissed me off...But, I believe the presentation went over smoothly.  The teacher slammed us with a poster project due tomorrow, I just finished doing my part of it.  Exciting.  Have you seen those Verb commericals?  You know, with the verbs?  Basketball people playing around, with the word ""run"" flying through their legs, and then a brief picture of them saying ""I love this verb.""  Yeah, pretty lame, huh?  I had a better idea.  Howsabout adjective commercials?  You could have an obese, sweaty, bald ugly guy bending over to pick up the last french (oh, excuse me,  freedom ) fries that he had dropped while slobbering over them, and then, while in the process of heaving himself back atop his trunks of legs, he could raise the fries in his piggy fingers and, with a smile, say: ""Fat.""   It would help people with their grammar even more!  Wow!  Amazing!  Yesterday, during wellness, the kids there and I had a conversation regarding our various encounters with moving cars that we had thrown rocks at.  Some of us had recalled how the drivers had screeched their tires and come back to scream at them, leaving them to only hide in the nearest trench that they could find.  Apparently, one time somebody threw a rock so hard it cracked the windshield.  But, anyway, as this conversation was concluding, our teacher, who is what could be referred to as a femme-nazi, noticed that ""only the boys do these kinds of things.""  Earlier in the day, she had also mentioned how women were ""winning the battle"" against men.  It can be thus concluded that she seeks to dominate and enslave men, rather than be equals to them and be content with it.  If there are enough people like her on earth, then maybe we'd better start making them wear dresses again...heheh...just kidding....  I saw Adaptation with Jarrod and Lily on saturday.  It was phenomenal, one of the best films I've ever seen.  It was written by the same guy who did Being John Malkovich, or, to be more precise, written by and about the same guy.  So many things worked perfectly.  Auggh...it was just brilliant.  I finally finished an incredibly boring art project thing.  I also finished 1984.  What a depressing book.  Yet it is also paralyzingly incredible...  I had hoped, from the beginning of reading it, that Winston would overcome The Party and help bring the world back to the way it was, with capitalism and delusions of freedom, etc.  But, to no avail.  I've written almost twenty pages in Intertwine over the last three days.  I feel so awesome about doing so.  I leave you, then, with my quote of the day, which I murmured while walking away from the school bus, which I usually have to flee from, because of a complex heirarchy of needs and...nevermind...here it is....  ""Fuck you, schoolbus."""	m
"50 posts today!  Today is my fiftieth post! 50 posts ago I gave an intro about myself, and started this wonderous thing called a blog. What a great decision that was. How else would you hear about THIS DRAMA! ""omgomgomgomg will he ever get back to florida?"", ""did he just call that dude hot?"", ""omgomgomg what a hottie!"", and ""omgomgomg teenage angst."" You've been with me in the good, the better, and the best. You were here when I published Red Dress, and you, yes you, read everyone one of my posts, found every secret message, and have tried to emulate my style. :( I can see it didn't work out. omg 50!  So, now that fifty posts have passed, what do I plan to do? Well, first of all I've decided to chop down many rainforests in an attempt to give Brazillian people homes. After that I think I'm going to start a campaign against women, and later I may begin my own country. Sounds cool, huh? Well, the only way to hear about me and my attempts to Nirvana is to read my blog, or call me, but nobody ever calls me. :(  This conversation has been dead on arrival! Fall out boy rocks :D.  Also, if you haven't seen my blog links yet, scroll down and pay attention to the right! Yeah, I made all of those :). I'm working on other people's for other blogs now. If you want to request one then e-mail me at 'notask8r@gmail.com.'  Today was cool because I'm so cool. I made everyone's blog links, which I'm proud of, and I tried to start ""The Odyssey"" again, but I got distracted. :(. I'm going to fail if I don't start it soon.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is one chapter in the greater unfolding serial of Michael Moore Vs. the Guys In Charge, and Chris Lehane is just as likely as Karl Rove to play Snidely Whiplash.

I got to talk to Jesse a little bit this morning, but its been rough because my mom took the week off from work and was telling me to do a bunch of things before I had to leave for work, so I was running back and forth doing what I needed to do and what she asked me to do and tried to talk to Jesse at the same time. Jesse is doing good, as far as I can tell and they are keeping him busy enough so I am very happy for that, even though it interferes with our chat time.   The days get closer to me leaving for Anaheim with my mom, her boyfriend, and my two nephews. We are scheduled to leave Sacramento sometime around 6:00 am Saturday morning and are set to return sometime on Tuesday. We will be spending one day at Knots berry Farm (Sunday) and one day in Disney Land (Monday). I am so happy about going but at the same time I am not too sure I am going to be able to enjoy my trip because I know I will be thinking about Jesse, like I do so often.  Tonight my mom and I are going to Target to buy some snack foods and other things for the trip. I know once we get there I probably wont have time to even worry about how Jesse is doing but at the same time that is what I am afraid of. I know if Jesse were here he would tell me to go, enjoy my trip. He would tell me that I need to get away and I should treat myself for my birthday. I know deep down that’s what I should do, but at the same time I don’t understand how anyone can possibly have fun when they have been placed into a situation like I have.  I know all Jesse wants me to do is have a good birthday and to treat myself to a good time…but really all I want for my birthday is Jesse to be home.	f

"urlLink    urlLink     This is Roald. Roald is cute. Roald knows this.  Which is why he gets away with bloody murder. The twelve pound little shit knows how to manipulate me.  Everything is all about him and what  he  wants. He is the most narcissistic, arrogant, aggressive, self-absorbed motherfucker I know other than me. Which is probably why we bonded instantly: we are the same.  That brain teaser led sort of tangentially (certainly not linearly) to the following theory:   Roald is the reincarnation of my grandfather.  Okay, I know this sounds flaky, but bear with me...I had this sense of ""recognition"" that I  know  Roald. As in before I met him. Like I've known him forever. Maybe the ""recognition"" wasn't solely due to us being similar in personality.  After pondering this a spell, I was lead to the following thought:  If this is true, then what the fuck did Grandpop do to get sent back as a  cat ?  Grandpop was a bit of a rogue (like yours truly), and he cheated on my grandmother constantly (if you knew her you'd know why), but he didn't do anything to deserve being sent back as a cat. That I know of.  It makes you think. Me, anyway.  So I ditched the Blues Fest due to my own personal laziness (Bad, Dave! Bad!), but I did manage to avoid having to go on the road and fight my way through horrible suburban traffic (Hah!). I took the L uptown and did all my errands. Took the L, walked, schlepped bags...Christ on a Fucking Crutch it was great to be a City Boy.   I also had an epiphany whilst on my quick haj: There are some gorgeous chicks here after all.  City chicks.  Cool city chicks.  No shit. They were everywhere. They were practically seeping from the walls as I walked down Chicago Avenue. And many with that desperate I-don't-have-a-boyfriend look.   It made me feel like I  was one of those murdering Islamists after taking out the World Trade Center, being sent to Paradise, and getting pimped 97 virgins to use for my personal pleasure. (Thanks, Allah!)  They were everywhere. Fucking everywhere.  And me so horny.  I was so surprised and shocked I couldn't deal. I scampered on home totally mind-fucked. This has exceeded all expectations.  But at least I think I understand why I haven't seen them until now: they've been inside hiding from Old Man Winter.   Now that the glaciers have thawed, they're coming out from their expensive post-Pleistocene caves to seek the warmth of the sun and engage in the summer mating ritual. How cool.  It seems the Charmed One's life is back. (Thanks, Allah!)"	m

I want to go toJC Penneys and shop but I don't thinkI'll be able to because noone can take me because my grandpa had a stroke and he's not allowed to drive and grandma's at work.The other day my mom asked me to dryoff the dishes and I ignored her [partly because she asked me and partly because I would be doing them beside her. I know that's horrible but I can't stand doing things she asks me to. Also, the other day she asked me togo to the pool and the only reason I said nowas because she would be wearing a bikini, her bikin's are more revealing than mine like she wears the kind that looks like a bra and underwear. If you have ever seen my motheryou would understand why that isa VERY bad idea.	f
2nd day I had not touched a cigarette. I am going Cold-Turkey. Was watching a video-clip by The National Tobacco Campaign. Oooo, really disgusting. I have seen a smokers lungs before and a drinkers liver, in JARS. Here, the clip is real with live organs. The brain was cool though and the lung...   So, I live up to this day that I really need to quit. Don't ask me why but even without the clip or any campaign, I felt it myself. I respect my life, I love myself more than anyone else.   So, ladies and gentlemen, if you start, know how to stop or else don't.  Life is Precious Precious it seems  like a speck in the sky so vast, so open yet, we throw life away?! What has become of us we reside in complacence we dwell in ignorence Where is the Chance for  Precious life? Gone forever...innocence is taken away, never to return the fire within, will not burn, Life, has never been so precious!	m
Uzo, you slimy putz. Don't be such a fiendish cretin. If I wanted you to be interim editor, I'd let you know. All the relevant people know the password to tcs@yahoo anyway, and we've got some copy in there.   At least ask before you try to usurp things you have nothing to do with. Quit being fiendish. I'm grounded; this is not a result of laziness. The only way I'm able to use the computer now is because I'm elsewhere. When my parental units come to their senses the Thought Crime Syndicate will be strong once more. The first issue back will be massive.  Don't do things like this again.

People whine we need international involvement but I see 30 or so countries are involved, I would like them to be more involved and I would like the U.N and france,germany involved (not cause I like them thats for sure) but we should still have the most control this they do not like, to bad then forget them, until they agree. As for N.Korea for know keep them under control I say and slow or stop them even if just temporarily until we finish with Iraq then we (with many others hopefully) go in and deal with them. These things will take time. As for Bush's speech tonight I will have coverage of but many democrats are saying he is doing the speech because polls currently are not in his favor, true and thats a good reason for him to. It does not show weakness he was likely planning a speech anyway either this is coincedence or a bonus and even if not who cares its politics and him fighting back is something he must do. Hopefully things will improve after this speech. See you later. :)	m

"((sighs)) ... Has anyone ever noticed that A) this blog shtick is quite addicting and B) just when you think everything in life is going peachy, karma comes back to laugh maniacally in your face despite the fact that your daily good deeds outweigh your bad? ((props head up on hand and looks at you))... I suppose I should describe a wee bit about myself before launching into this entry, though... how rude of me to babble long before I introduce myself...  As you can tell from my previous entries, my name is Meg, and I seem to live a very bored and highly uninteresting life at the moment { c'mon.. who else posts 3 times in a night? } I moved from my semi-native home of Eielson AFB, Alaska about two years ago to the one-streetlighted town of Podot, USA.. middle of the midwest.. yay for me.. Anywho though, since moving to this wee little town (Podot is the kind of place that, if you sneezed while driving, you'd pass it up completely) I've not only found a more cynical, sarcastic side to my otherwise outgoing personality (hence the title 'Ultimate Cynic Woman'... bow in homage.. kidding.. if you want to though, yay! I have more victims... er.. followers.. hehe..) but also joined my town's Winterguard Troupe *yes, you people out there.. I'm still a lowly highschooler* and found an absolutely amazing man.. we shall call him Mistah J, master of spider squishing for his uber-aracnaphobic girlfriend, and keeper of all things squishy.. (Mr. J will do though) thus far he hasnt run screaming for the cornfeilds yet, and has stuck around for a whopping four and a half months.. (I said it was the midwest... we dont have hills.. just cornfeilds.. its sad) Besides all that, superficially speaking, I'm a pretty average chick *with exception to my height*.. I come in at a rather petite 4'11"", with blue/green eyes and ever-changing reddish hair (that reminds me- note to self- dye hair.. again..)  Moving on to the key subject of my entry today- Mr. J-  ((sighs))  Simply put, he said he got off work at 4pm... it's 11:05pm.... we usually meet up after he gets off work because he tends spend his daytime hours working on his car and flipping burgers at the local McDonalds *dont worry- just a temporary job.. he plans on going into aeronautical mechanics.. yes, we're  both  in high school... gasp..* and I tend to spend my daytime hours bumming around the house and hoping a job will miraculously fall into my lap.. (hey, atleast I'm kinda looking.. ish..not really..) In any case though, we meet up and talk to one another during the few hours we can actually be together... end of work till about midnightish... unfortunately though, he's not here... and instead of talking to him, I'm on Blog babbling about him not being here.. again... yes, I am odd.. and have probably irritated you all ((maniacal laugh)) ahem.. sorry.. In any case though, I have to be hopping... perhaps he'll decide to come over... perhaps..  here's to wishing  ~Megs the odd Irish chick who is insanely odd when alone at night.."	f

I had to reinstall Windows XP Pro over the weekend when a bad driver which worked fine up till Friday decided to nuke my system.  The only way to boot was to do it in Safe Mode which bites.  It was my onboard Ethernet a SiS 900 on a ECS M810S board or what they call a KVSEM.  The driver was trying to go past its allocated memory space.  What had started it was a power outage, one second, and that's when it died.  I've had the driver corrupted twice already and thought that was the issue. Spent most of Friday and Saturday trying to fix it.  We eventually bought a replacement NIC which works great so I have my cable internet back.  Cheap system builder.  Anyways I've been wading through Casssandra Claire's trilogy  urlLink Draco Dormiens ,  urlLink Draco Sinister  and  urlLink Draco Veritas .  Beautiful stuff.  Draco Veritas in Word set in Garamond 12 is 800 pages long and 300k words.  I would hate to print that mess out.  :)  And she's not finished! I was very relieved that I had put almost all my settings and documents on a separate partition which meant I didn't lose my stuff.  I do have to reinstall everything and get my settings back which sucks but much better than losing stuff from my last back up till now.  :)	f

Dear Lei;I just got off of the phone to you. I enjoy just talking to you. You are so much to me. The most important thing that I can say you are to me is my best friend. I am glad that I have a friend such as you. I have so few friends. I value my friendship with you above everything else. If you and I had not become friends, our love would not have grown. I think it is very important for couples to be friends before anything else. I am thankful that you and I are friends above everything else. I do not know what I would do without you. I live each and every minute of every day just thinking of spending the rest of our lives together. I have such hope and faith i our relationship. I know that we each have our fears bout different things, I have some too. The thing that gives me the most hope is how well that you and I understand each other. I also enjoy how open that you and are with each other. each of us can express our concerns and fears and the other one reassures the one with the fears and together we figure out a solution. I could not ask for a better partner in life. I look forward to the day that you and I can hold each other in each others arms again. You and I have learned in our long distance relationship not to take each other for granted. We know how valuable our time together really is. With you and I starting this way, I do not think we will ever take each other for granted. We will just be thankful for our time that we have together. I am going to go for now my love. Until the next time.I Love You So Much LeiForever  AlwaysLove Kevin	m

urlLink Technology Professional Development: A Case Study  This is a new online full-text article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly .  It is by Dolores T. Burton at the New York Institute of Technology.  From the article:  This study examined the outcomes of a technology professional development initiative for elementary teachers. The professional development model used cohort collaboration, multiple strategies, and job embedded experiences to help teachers incorporate technology into their practice. Five sources of evidence, surveys from administrators and teachers, as well as interviews from teachers, computer aides and the staff developer were used to examine outcomes. The evidence identified a change in teacher practice and belief that included an increase in the self-reported frequency of the use of technology, the use of computers for research and project-based learning, and the Internet for instruction. The changes identified were consistent with the Phases of Instructional Change (Sandholtz, Ringstaff,  Dwyer, 1992).	m

Max, you are not allowed to have an opinion of BBC THREE as you can't actually get that channel unless you got digital in the past few days.

Also Max if we ski, we all ski together. Ski school is in the morning and afternoon, and if you want to you can ski after that for a little while. The slopes are 30 minute drive from the hotel.

Wow is all I have to say, I found gluten free cookies, rice cakes and real feta cheese here today! It was all an insane price but that is fine they are important to me and thus I will pay!   Taipei is great and everything is going well. The new job is wonderful, I have 4,5, and 6 year olds for the summer camp and then in mid August I will have a class, yes just one, (what a novel idea) I am hoping it will be kindergarten (depends on enrollment) and then I will have one after school language arts class every day. The school is in great spot and has great classrooms and resources. I am looking forward to all the things that go with having my own class even concerts and report cards…. ask me again around Christmas.  The apartment that I found is pretty good, not amazing but I do have lots of my own space and it will do for the summer, I will probably try to find my own place in the fall once I know the city better. There are 4 people who live downstairs but we seem to keep fairly opposite schedules so it works out ok.   Taipei is beautiful, there are trees everywhere and it is very tropical. The weather is around 30 everyday and humid. There are heaps of mosquitoes too, I could do without those. I spent this past weekend staying is a great little hotel not to far away and got some sight seeing done.   I went to a great little Buddhist temple, to an observation deck in the “old tallest” building and to some amazing markets. The streets here are filled with vendors and stalls like in Korea but the selection here is much different and I have seen more chicken/goose parts than I could ever want to. They eat everything, except the feathers. The fruit is divine, I could live just off pineapple, watermelon and mango’s. There is heaps of selection in the grocery stores and most people speak English, at least a little bit. On Saturday night I saw Harry Potter, definitely a high point for me. On Sunday I went to this great market that happens every weekend under a bridge it is divided up into a few sections flowers, jade and crafts, it was really neat.   Today I went to the world’s tallest building (at the moment) it is huge, it’s called the Taipei 101 building and has amazing stores including my dreamy grocery store and the hugest bookstore ( I stayed away from it). I want to go back and just wander around, it has amazing security and the whole thing is quite impressive, the bottom 5 levels are shopping and the rest is offices.   Hmmm what else can I tell you about, not much else has happened since I have only been here for 5 days! Getting out of Korea was a bit challenging but I did finally leave and arrived here in one piece with all of my stuff in tow.   Hope you are all well, I’ll write again soon.   Love J	f

"THIS IS GOOD   From   urlLink Brian   about  Farenheit 9/11 .   ""- The woman who lost her son in Iraq was a very sympathetic person. Who doesn't feel for a mother who has lost her son? I cannot be the only person who caught this, but I think others have and are afraid to mention it for fear of seeming insensitive. (I myself have wavered over writing this, and I only get 150 hits a day.) The woman who lost her son said that when she was told, ""she dropped the phone."" I thought I heard that wrong, but a moment later she said she was all alone and had ""no one to hold her up."" I was outraged. The United States military informs next of kin directly, without exception, no matter where they are. For example, they went deep into the mountains in Mexico to inform a lost soldier's mother directly. I am not calling the woman a liar, but I am sure that Moore intended to leave the impression that our military is completely insensitive.""   Is anyone else thinking what I was thinking while reading this?  Moore coached her into saying it was a phone call instead of a face to face meeting.  There's correction number one for Truthenheit 9-11.com.  Like the name?  Good work, Brian.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing"	m

You are a little late on this one G. The US papers and news don't show pictures of captured US soldiers  until  their families are notified. You don't want to be flicking through the channells and find out that your son is captured. Once the military notifies the family then the US shows the pictures on TV. All of the capstured soldiers have been shown by now on TV as their families have been notified.  There is also no way an A[pache can be shot down with a rifle, it was anti-aircraft fire.   And I read and watch BBC news, NYTimes, Drudgereport, pravda, The Times, and various other sources.	m

if you are reading this, and you know who i am, welcome.  pray for the CpR retreat this weekend.  i have 7 guys, so pray for significant time with them.  and for my breakout session with very cool Gary Alker.  its about choices and excellence.  we'll see how it goes.	m
"I'm really, really over-tired, so I'm going to make this as brief as I can.  The Les Mis performances were cool, although to my mind they started brilliantly and ended on a comparative low (I think it would have still been a high if I wasn't judging it against the first night, though). Was über-fun to do. I'm really going to miss all of the peoples who have been really nice during it... mostly James, Harry, Josie + Chrissie, Phil + Christina, Simon, Susie, Liv, Jack, Joe, N'omi, Rhi (obviously), Barley and Tom, who is in actuality an adult-ish but he's so irresponsible it's just funny...  Prime example of Tom's irresponsibility was yesterday. I'll get onto that though, I'll go step by step. Well, afterwards, I got my banner from Scott *hugs* and got changed. Oh, actually, missed out a stage.  Went into town with all the peoples at 3ish, and we wandered round, mostly in Millennium Music where we spent over an hour buying a plectrum (there was a woman called Laura something who Shez knows. Pity Shez wasn't with us at the time. But anyway, she's cool). Met Shez, and I bought cards for Liv, Phil + Christine, Jo + N'omi + Barley, Jake, Simon, James and Josie + Chrissie (my reasoning for not getting Jack one was that I bought him one for his birthday so that can suffice in my opinion. I only have a finite amount of money). That ended up costing me £11.55. Anyway, took t'lads back to my house and went off to Les Mis. You know, then we had the performance which went well. Liv and I both cried quite a lot during Rain. In My Life was as heartbreaking for me as always.  Right, back to afterwards. We had the after show party! Woo! I played the guitar and made up a ""We finished Les Mis"" song and basically the entire cast joined in clapping in time. It ruled. Simon, Phil and I did Californication together and Under The Bridge... this is what you get for knowing RHCP fans. Oh, and I did a Piano + Guitar/Vocs duet, with one of the backstage crew, of Imagine, and that was pretty cool. We also did a piano duet of Peter Gunn, in which I did my tune bit and let him improv. You know how these jazz players are. Seriously, though, the guy was on fire. Not literally. We spent the rest of the time really singing through songs and swapping roles - for instance, Phil and I did the docks, Phil being Fantine and... well, I'm glad that's probably not something people got a picture of. We did One Day More and I got to be Javert! Yay! Found out Liz, Jack's mini sister, is actually... not that mini... in fact she's 16. Now, I find her good looking, so I'm glad she's not as old as I thought she was. I thought she was in like Yr9, not Yr11... that's the only recent misjudging of age that I've made where I've judged someone to be younger than they actually are. But yeah, still... über-cool thing was, she had 2 people coming to see her, and one of them was the flautist (Beccy) for GODS' Music Night, that I did the trombone for way back in October. Well, I talked to her a fair bit. I really didn't expect to see her ever again. That was odd.  Anyway, went back to Andrea's afterwards and we basically... well, sad to say but we did things like this; ""Look down, look down, don't fart 'em in the eye. Look down, look down, you're here until you fart. The fart is strong, it's hot as hell below. Look down, look down, there's 20 farts to go. I've done no fart... sweet Jesus, hear my fart..."" and so on. Sorry, Les Mis fans. It was incredibly fun though. Oh, and Beccy sat on my lap and we were generally closish. Which is odd, given that meeting again ever would be incredibly unlikely. But yeah, she was cool, and not so sensible as last time. Which is a good thing, believe me. But yeah... Barley got pissed on like a glass of gin. Oh, while I think about it, whisky and Pepsi is not a good mixer. Trust me. Liv thought what I'd written in her card was really sweet and gave me a lot of hugs and sat on me for quite a while. I think I'm becoming a bit of a ladies' man. Oh well, it's nice to have someone there. It would be nicer if I actually was going out with them but that's not looking likely for a while, at least. Anyway. Yeah, we watched the dress rehearsal (it was recorded) and I ruled for some of it... I'm sorry, but I did! I'm proud of me at the moment. Getting to sleep was the hard part. At the beginning I was kinda sharing a cover with James but N'omi (who Tom said probably fancied me... not meaning to sound really smug but it was guessable, she has that puppy-dog look with me all the time. Which either means she wants me, din-dins, or both)  said it'd work better if she had less room because she's smaller (like 1 foot smaller) so I went to where she'd been and head-to-toed with Harry, who's small but has really long legs so it's hard to get comfy. Anyway, so I got bugger all sleep.  But yeah. Really tired. That took too long *dies*. The thing about being over-tired is I get very depressed, it's what happens to me, so I'm kinda thinking about someone who lives near Winchcombe a lot.

almost all moved in now...or at least moved out. now i just got a room full of crap that i collected over the months, but will prolly never use. time to box it up and ship it home. i've also realize how much junk i need to go out and buy.  i'm in 3rd nephi and decided i'm gonna finish the  urlLink book of mormon  by christmas. it should be rather easy.  time to hop in bed so i can catch my flight in the morning to good ol' boise	m
Woooo. Dave informs me his biceps have grown mysteriously. now they are huge. But i am stronger than him. Grrrr, check out my strength, woo, etc.	m
Hey Michele.  I think you should do whatever works best for you, but I decided not to do it in the round, even though I saw the pattern adaptation (thanks to the person who did that, though I confess I forgot your name).  I tend to do anything I can in the round, but I decided that it would be more trouble to keep track of the increases and decreases around the waist than it would be to sew the darned thing up when I was done.  It's only four seams and two of them are just an inch and a half and can be kitchenered if you want.  So that's my $0.02.  But I fully support you if you decide to do it in the round, and I'll be interested to hear how it goes!  As for me, I have done maybe two rows today, sigh.  It took DD TWO HOURS to fall asleep tonight (2-year molars will be the death of me!).  So no downtime for me!  Well, I suppose I'm just staying up late for it instead. :)  Cate	f
It's 4:30 am and I am up for whatever reason (probably too much sleep) and I was looking for some Celebrity Web Logs to add to my link list, blog roll, what ever.  And I found a treasure.   urlLink William Shatner  keeps a web log/fan site.  I took a look at it and it seems like he writes an entry every few weeks or so.  So naturally, I joined and posted a reply to his most recent entry about excellence.  Anyway, he looks like a pretty decent writer and a pretty down to earth guy.    ================================================   a little bit later that morning . . . Okay.  It's way too early to be having this much fun.  Not to be outdone by his former Star Trek colleague, George Takei, also keeps a web log.  His website is very nice as well.  I recommend you  urlLink link  to it, right now, this minute!!!  In his most recent entry, he writes a touching account of visiting Arkansas, where he and his family were interned during WWII.	f
"Post.  This is my blog.  Yo.  Yo.  Kick it DJ, spin dat beat. I left Florida Friday night and got to Dubuque, Iowa Saturday night.  I met Sara Jean at The Village Inn on Dodge St. and we drank coffee and had french toast.  It was good.  Then we went to her house, showered up and went to a Salsa House Party.  Salsa as in dancing, not a mexican dip party.  The party was wild and out of control and huge.  So many sexy women with beers in the cleevage.  It was bizarre but I behaved myself like a perfect gentleman because Sara Jean was there.  Later, Sara and I bought bubble guns and shot bubbles all over Dubuque.   We even made a little video with a digital camera.  I had a great time with Sara Jean.  I got to Osage on Monday afternoon and hung out with the family.  Monday night I went for a drive in the country with my brother, Ryan.  I drove out to the house that Jill used to live in...and I spent some time on the one lane bridge.  I told Ryan a little bit about her, but mostly I didn't say anything.  That was good, but I'm going back there tonight, by myself, and I'm going to stay there longer.  Yesterday (Tuesday) Ryan, my pops, and I went to visit my sister, Meghan, in Ames, Iowa.  She's going to school at Iowa State.  She's a cyclone.  We all ate coffee and I bought a black soccor ball and we all went out to a soccor field and played soccor until it had been dark for an hour.  Playing soccor by moon light with a black ball is really hard, especially if your the goalie.  I made my brother be the goalie.  HA HA HA.  Today or tomorrow, I plan on goign to the Spam museum in Ausitn, MN.  My friend Chris Klatt should be coming down tomorrow or so.  I'll be here until Saturday and then I'll be heading back to Florida.  Crappy crappy Florida.  But for now, I'm having a very good time.

"Per Reuters,  urlLink the U.S. will oppose action by the U.N.  based upon the World Court ruling denouncing the security barrier.  Palestinians face a brick wall of U.S. opposition to possible United Nations (news - web sites) action against Israel after the World Court ruled the Jewish state's West Bank barrier was illegal and should be dismantled.  ""We don't think there's a need for (U.N.) General Assembly action at this point,"" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said after the World Court, the U.N.'s top legal body, announced its non-binding ruling in The Hague (news - web sites) on Friday. The General Assembly can, and probably will, denounce Israel and demand a dismantling of the barrier.  And?  And nothing, any General Assembly resolution will be non-binding, and the U.S. will block any Security Council motion.  Why?  Because we see that the Israelis have a right to defend themselves against Palestinian terrorism.  Who cares about the judgement of a ""world court"" led by a judge from the justice-and-freedom-loving nation of China.  The Palestinians later intend to take their case to the 15-nation Security Council, where the United States -- Israel's main ally, vetoed a resolution last October that sought to bar the Jewish state from extending the West Bank barrier.  In The Hague, Nasser al-Kidwa, the U.N. Palestinian observer, declined to say whether he would push for sanctions against Israel.  ""It remains the obligation of the international community to ensure that compliance takes place. We will take it step by step,"" he said .... The court said the barrier, which is about a third built, ""severely impeded"" Palestinian rights to self-rule. I want to go on record as saying the major impediment to Palestinian self-rule is the terrorist Arafat.  The Palestinians have had many opportunities to take the peace route;  each time, they have found an excuse to venture down the road less traveled by the peaceable. Opinion polls show strong support in Israel for the project.  ""The choice was between the inconveniences which are caused to the Palestinians -- and we recognize that there are inconveniences -- but the fence doesn't kill,"" said Israeli Vice Premier Ehud Olmert."	m
How they vote in the UN.     Below are the actual voting records of various Arabic/Islamic States which are recorded in both the US State Department and United Nations' records:  Kuwait votes against the United States 67% of the time.

Jordan votes against the United States 71% of the time.  Tunisia votes against the United States 71% of the time.  Saudi Arabia votes against the United States 73% of the time.  Yemen votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Algeria votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Oman votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Sudan votes against the United States 75% of the time.  Pakistan votes against the United States 75% of the time.  Libya votes against the United States 76% of the time.  Egypt votes against the United States 79% of the time.  Lebanon votes against the United States 80% of the time.  India votes against the United States 81% of the time.  Syria votes against the United States 84% of the time.  Mauritania votes against the United States 87% of! the time.     US Foreign Aid to those that hate us:  Egypt, for example, after voting 79% of the time against the United States, still receives $2 billion annually in US Foreign Aid.  Jordan votes 71% against the United States and receives $192,814,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.  Pakistan votes 75% against the United States receives $6,721,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.  India votes 81% against the United States receives $143,699,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.

Me again...just extreamly sore this time. Wow. I didnt know I could be in so much pain from just a little cheerleading and dance. I guess I'll star t with last night tho. It was...bad. I was getting angry and emotional so I called Arik and everything was better...Can always count on him to make me smile. Hes so wonderful. So yeah that was a big interesting mess that I got myself out of. Anyways then today I got up around 8 and went out to the school for cheerleading. Ugh. I was soo extreamly tired...since I was up late talking to Arik and my mom. So we warmed up and I didn't have any breathing problems so I knew already that this year was better. We worked on some new cheers and did some stunts. We went over positions and jumps and then went to lunch. I walked over to Godfathers...yeah. Then walked back and sat around for awhile cuz no one else was back yet. Then we had cheer talk and then learned a dance. Im really bad at it now..its way to fast. Its to the song Yeah. Wow its fast. ugh. I will hopefully have it almost all down by tomorrow. Then we did more stunts and then got evaluated on a cheer and prep. It was a somewhat fun day I guess...Im just sooo sore. But that just means Im working...getting tight positions and all that. Plus I found out that someone droped Varsity so I might get to cheer some games. I don't know the exsact details to anything yet we'll figure it all out on the first day of school. So yeah...thats about all that went on today...tomorrow I'll be doing the same....just extra sore....my neck is the worst. I was counting on seeing Arik this Friday...but its not gonna work out. The 20th may tho....so then I can see him...and he can stay 3 whole days here...yay!  Anyways...Im gonna head off now....later all...  -Tara	f

Fly home to California for my first visit since I had moved to New York. Although I had not been away for all that long, I was over excited to go home and see everyone. When I arrived home, there was another surprise visitor at the house, DAD!!! On the 13th we went to Casey’s promotion, and Ryan’s High School graduation. On the 14th I threw Michelle, one of my best frineds from High School,her Bridal Shower, and on the 15th, Father’s day, I spent quality time with my family, tiling the upstairs!

MODERN TALKING .. hehe.. for those who dont know what the heck this is, modern talking is some 80s band that my dad loves, and probably still does and we used to travel from Kuantan to KL listening to these kinds of songs .. visiting mom .. those years of long ago .. he used to make us listen to BONEY M too, and after a few rebellious fights about not wanting to listen to some big haired, big braided group of singing weirdos ... we had to succumb to dad's choice simply because it was his car and he was driving .. so that began the whole journey of into dad's head of sing-a-long songs .. =) it makes me smile every time i listen to the two cds, not because i like them, it's because the songs remind me of simpler times of being loved by only your parents and not having to deal with the outside world.  come to think about it, life really was a whole lot simpler then.. i mean yeah ive had crushes and ive rebelled a lot to get to those crushes (countless myriads of british boys in my early teenhood, regardless) but those crushes and so called ""first loves"" have no bearing upon the two big ones that i have had in my young adulthood. in fact, the first one i had just before this one, seemed a lot simpler than the one i have now .. i dont know what it is, perhaps the fact that im a certain awkward age and that i have been burned down once, or perhaps that we are living together, makes it feel a whole lot more ... not burdensome, but weighs a whole lot more.e  simpler times of puppy love reminds me of whitney houston songs .. omg .. i used to come home after school (go Limehurst High!) at the age of 13, dream about a certain hazel-eyed, brunette young man by the name of Paul R. and wish he would stop staring at my fair haired best friend, Sarah and concentrate on the more awkward looking, trying to blend in Malaysian girl, who just started school ..   then there was Stuart F., my first ""real"" boyfriend, age 14. haha, this one is funny .. i had to try going out with him three times before i could settle down with the idea that we are a couple.. it just seemed so wrong, and he was such a scrawny blonde haired, blue eyed, true Aryan boy... i have him to thank for, for the many kissing moves that i have .. haha.. as if i had more than one :p   then there were those hunks that didn't quite look like hunks when they were in junior high but at the end of junior high into middle school, blossomed into the hunkiest of all hunks .. i shared my fantasy and dreams with one of my best friends from england, because we BOTH liked this guy (if you are reading this and recognize who you are, remember those times? when we drooled and fought on who should sit next to him on the bus? hehe) ... the boy in question is no other than Andrew P., also known as PONCHO (dont ask, i dont know)... i remembered in 8th grade, he used to sit across from me in MISSUS MADDOCK's class in Maths, and stare at me and try to get my attention in so many ways .. even Graham said he had a crush on me, but Ponch was such an awkward kid back then.. his hair wasn't properly cut, and he just had a whole lot of baby fat on him still, hehe we used to pinch his love handles to drive him mad ..   .... and THEN ....  come 9th grade, he freaking turned into a HOTTIE .. and not to mention 10th grade in Burleigh Comm. College, he was like, wreaking fermones or sth and all these girls would flock to him, sighing and swooning .. it was kinda cute .. at that time though, i had other crushes already, too many to even list down here .. they were all white boys, needless to say (i think i like my white men, what can i say) .. lets see shall we .. if i listed them all you will die of shock but this is quite fun to reminisce:  1. Paul Rycroft 2. Stuart Freer 3. i think i kinda like Adam Freer too, hehe 4. Andrew Pycroft 5. Mark Adkin 6. Adam Fairweather (more Shazz's thing but he was damned cute) 7. Adam Roper 8. Johnny sth, couldnt remember his last name 9. Lee .. err ... sth he was cute but he became my best friend for a whilee 10. Nikki sth, i just thought he was adorable, but like, about a foot shorter than i was hehe  those are the only ones i remember .. mind you the only one i dated out of all of those crushes was Stuart, for like, 6 months or something, i think, before he dumped me to go after my best friend .. i swear, all the dumpings have been painful for me .. but watever ...   then i came home, and had crushes on a few malay men, but gave up on those and came back to the US to get me another hot white american .. well, after i got me a somewhat decent looking malaysian men who claims to be a chicagoan (hehe just kidding!!! you are oh-so-hot! :p)  ROFL  alrite, time for me to leave this playground and go to another one, that is ASP.NET... *sigh* i wish my prof could speak real english, his sounds too guttural to be understood properly."	f

I'm in Vancouver for a few days, visiting friends and all..it's been great fun, and I'm enjoying missing school, and being spoiled. I've also done someone's homework for them. I can't sleep, the migraine put me out today, so I'm wiiiide awake..I'm up to 4 extra strength tylenol to try and stop it. Too bad it isnt working.  I've been hanging out with an old friend, past love lately. And a feeling I thought had gone away looong ago are coming back. And I can almost feel that he feels the same way too. But I'm stuck. Last time, I felt the flame extinguish, and the love die, and we separated. I hated that. I still do. I was such a horrible person, and if this guy reads this, then I'm apologizing. I'm so lost though, as to what to do.   Feelings for a lot of ex-somethings are coming back, and for some reason I'm scrambling to get all my friends back. Maybe I'm getting paranoid again. Maybe I just don't want to be alone. I dont know and I wish I did.   35 days till winnipeg. Maybe I'll be something.  I dont want to grow old alone, I dont want to grow old, end my pain now and gooooo......	f
"It is called  Scary Shit . Let me know what you think of it!   Scary Shit   by Amanda   It was dark out, and it was raining. A young, big-breasted woman named Candie Barr was hanging out alone by the pool in her backyard. She was very rich.  ""I think I'm going to take my clothes off and skinny dip in my pool,"" she said to herself. She took off her clothes and jumped into the pool. Little did she know, a man with a knife was watching her from the shadows.  ""I feel like I'm being watched,"" Candie said, once again talking to herself.  ""That's because I'm watching you,"" said Man With The Knife.  ""Oh, well then that makes sense!"" Candie said ditzyly. But then she realized she was talking to a man with a knife in his hand. ""Oh noes!"" she screamed, covering up her enormous breasts with her arms. ""Are you going to kill me?""  ""Yes,"" said Man With The Knife.  ""Crap!"" said Candie. She got out of the pool and walked over to Man With The Knife. ""Please don't kill me!"" she pleaded.  Man With The Knife ignored her, and stabbed her until she was dead.    THE END   Watch for the sequal, coming soon."	f

Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart among the rags and the bones and the dirt. There's piles of lies, the love gone from her eyes, and old moving boxes full of hurt. Pull up a chair by the trouble and care. I got whiskey, you're welcome to some. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart, but I don't reckon you're gonna come.  I've tried to fix up the place, I know it's a disgrace, you get used to it after a while - with the flood and the drought and old pals hanging out with their IOU's and their smiles. bare naked women keep coming in and they dance like you wouldn't believe. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart, so take a good look - and then leave.  Oh Lord, why does the Fall get colder each year? Lord, why can't I learn to love? Lord, if you made me, it's easy to see that you all make mistakes up above. But if I open the door, you will know I'm poor and my secrets are all that I own. Oh Lord, I have made you a place in my heart and I hope that you leave it alone.  -Greg Brown  Yup.	f
"On your mark, get ready, set.... GOOOO!!!!!...  Oh how the streets on Montreal have become race tracks. Everyone....  ok maybe not everyone, but 90% of the people in Montreal do not know how to drive safely.Ok, people can say thatthe streets are not fit for good drivers....I mean with all the murder holes, or should I say pot-holeson the streets to ambush these war or assassins' vehiclethat we call cars, are all there to serve as obstacles to ""test"" the driver's skills and verify that the driver is alert at all time...Oh how much I must saythanks to the government of Quebec for public funding to repair the streets...How they always repair that stupid same highway from years to years...(15 on the Decarie level, anyone?) but never repairs some of the streets. Then, to add more problems, well there's the number of lanes in the streets and highways...What's wrong with those engineers....2 lanes.....need I say more...What kind of big city have 2 freakin' lanes at highway interchanges...Turcot interchange(where the 20 meets the 720 and the 15), or how about those freakin' bridge like the Champlain bridge...With a population of about 3.3 Millions in the metropolitan area of Montreal, you would think that engineers would think about making the number of lanes more than freakin' 2 lanes....Ok, so this being said, traffic is really bad in Montreal   To make things worst, as if that wasn't enough..There's the people....YES the PEOPLE. Awww Montreal, where the city speed limit is only a suggestion. Now you would think that with all thedespicable road conditions, people would actually be more careful or drive slower...Guess again, how stupidpeople can sometimes be, is truly amazing. People think that their racing against freakin' Micheal Schumacher...and I don't mean just the people driving regular cars...I mean everyone in Montreal!!! Even bus drivers...Oh don't get me started with them...Some of themhavea donkey's behindattitude with the intelligence of a brain obtained from a box of Cracker Jack...Where do they get these bus driver...So to show you an example of the ""excellent"" service on the37 circuit,here is an example...And it happens quite frequently...Not just once and a while..I meanalmost everyday frequent....   First, as I wait for the bus at the bus stop, well it can be sometimes really hot, really cold, rainy or snowy depending onthe weather. So as I'm waiting,the buses from the 37 circuit is either too early, or too late...But when you come in a bit late..They never wait for you, and actually drives a lil slower so the drivercan wave their hand and say Bye. Or if they want to be on time, they hurry to arrive early, and they let the bus at the stop so that the chauffeur can have his or her break...away from the bus...so, instead of letting the people in, they let the people stay outside in the bad weather and the chauffeur always go back in the warmth somewhere unknown where all decent or not chauffeur go during breaks. Ok, so after letting the people stay in the bad weather, they let everyone in and show how they have power and control the almighty bus by demonstrating their cantankerous behavior. But hey, it can be understandable..I mean you're driving all day, making about 60k a year, with lots of benefits, and overtime, and you get to be on strike for any reasons paralyzing the whole population using public transportation, oh and you have to deal with people sometimes...Life can be soo hard for them :P...anywhooo..as i wait there to ring the bell to stop just before my stop, i ring the bell...i look around in the bus to see how many people will get out....There's about 5-10 people in the bus but none except me that wants to get out, nothing the driver can't handle.....So as I wait to get out in front of the doors, the drivers starts to accelerate..Then I'm like err WTF,why drive so fast when the stop is only about 100 meters away. Well I start waving, and quickly saw that it was not very effective, so  ......Then as I give the WTF stare and watch the bus driver through the mirror, he doesn't mind me.....So as I walk up the alley to the main entrance of the bus and go to the driver and tell him  me: hey I don't mean to be rude, but you missed my stop...  Bus Driver: oh, did I?(pretending to care) oh I'm sooo sorry....well I just didn't see you nor the stop....  me: yeah it's ok (thinking yeah right Jack A**, you couldn't hear the bell, couldn't see the bus stop sign, and didn't bother looking in your mirror)  B. D.: oh well I guess I could let you out here..(meanwhile he's still driving)  me: yeah here would be nice...(if you really meant it, why didn't you stop before saying it)  ok so this is one of the many examples that reflect the attitude of the people driving in Montreal..FASTER is better....now, picture and imaginethis, imagine a bigger scale of those kind of people, but all driving on the highway or on the streets....hogging thelanes as if the street belong to them. Cause most of them think that because they pay taxes, the street is rightfully theirs since it comes from THEIR money....So you see, people, drive fast..say on average 120 when the speed limit is 70, occasionally cut people cause there just soo many drivers..that people driving fast tend to driver even faster...cause it's not a race, but they don't want to be stuck behind in the so-called traffic, oh and did I mention that we had to dodge the pot-holes, now adding to this, you have the small number of lanes serving a big population of cars...which in the end gives you...a big nightmare...  BTW, it's not just bus drivers..even the ""special"" people from those ""special Olympics"" do that too...the other day I saw2 physically challenged..or should I say freaksin a wheel chair racing on the side street on those electric wheel chair... >.  i'm not saying that when i drive, i'm a safe and perfect driver...but geez..PEOPLE use your comon sense......we're bound to go down as a society...."	m
I don't understand how a person can break another person's heart, one of which has already been broken several times. i guess the pain takes a deeper cut than before, and then the wound would take longer to heal. I don't understand how I can continue on with my life this way, with all these negative thoughts filling up my mind and only adding confusion to my heart. I don't know why I hold on when I know everything is just wrong and I don't deserve to be treated this way. I'm better than that, and I know that one day everything will be brighter for me.  I never stopped hoping for things to go back to the way they were, but that feeling of hope is slowly fading away with my desperation and sadness. I don't know why I'm still crying and why I still hurt. Every night I'd pray that one day I'll wake up and forget that anything has ever happened. Sigh all I've been wanting is to feel complete happiness..even for just a minute.  You know how you think things are going to end up throughout the day? Then again, you know deep inside that nothing is perfect. So even if that moment even comes close to being described to 'perfect', it never really is. I've never been that good at lying, I'm a bad liar. I can admit to that, so most of the time I try to avoid situations that would make me lie. Maybe the better word for it is 'bending the truth'.   Everytime he looks into my eyes and asks me if I'm alright.. he has no idea how much it hurts just looking at him that way. Every day my heart is breaking more because I know, I know more than ever, that everytime I tell him that I love him.. he wants to believe me, but he can't. He wants things to go the way it should, but we both know that it really can't. Not with the way things are going right now.. not with all the interventions and the pain I keep feeling in my heart.   Life is like a song. Everything seemed so perfect.. it is too good to last. I should have known better, but I guess I was being too hopeful. I should have learnt my lesson years ago, because it has happened once. Look at it now. There's a cut in my heart, and the memories are engraved into my soul. I should have known..   I'm trying so hard not to cry right now.	f

"So, I was thinking tonight, as I lied on the couch staring at the imperfections in the paint no the ceiling, what would I do if a foreign country, as opposed to a domestic one, declared war on the US and landed on it's beaches and started razing our cities and raping our women and the like? Would I leave and go to a neutral country and wait it out? Would I fight for my homeland? Would I fight for the other side? And in trying to answer all these questions, I had to ask myself ""What does America mean to me?"" meaning why do I love it? Do I even love it? Is it the land, the people, or the philosophy or the ideals or a little bit of all that makes me so attached to the place? And of course, what makes me not want to move to any other place, even after taking into consideration all the flaws in this country?  I came to the following conclusion, I would fight for my country, but not because any president or leader me so, but because I'd be fighting for something more than just an individual. I'd be fighting for an idea, no matter how poorly US keeps to it now, that you are nothing if not free to express and think what you want. It's kind of like how that guy, I forget his name, but he said something to the effect of ""I may disagree with what you say, but I respect it and will die for your right to say that."" So, yeah, I'd fight for my country despite it's flaws because the ideals are great, not necessarily the individuals we have in place now.  In conclusion, I'm not afraid to fight and die for something, I'm just very skeptical about what is worth such an expense.  I love The United States of America, forever my home.  That is all. -- Feanor"	m
Wow. It's been so long since I posted that the posting format at BlogSpot has changed. I apologize for my lack of interest in this blog, and I assure you that there will be much writing in the next few weeks. Right now I'm in Colorado, which is the most beautiful state I've seen so far. I could move here and be happy, I'm sure of it. What's not to love about mountains in the distance and wide open spaces? I'm here with my mom and my sister Jacqui, visiting my other sister Katy, and it's been an extraordinary week of talking, reconnecting, and recharging. Three babies, four women, and a lot of laughter. I'm completely smitten with my nephew Isaac and my niece Emma. Despite all that, I'm ready to go home and sleep in my own bed.

Much cuter than Disneyland. Much shorter lines. Most of the park was reasonably cool and shady even though it was 90 degrees on Saturday. Unfortunately it has many fewer princesses and much less cool souvenir stuff to buy than Disney. I’m in love. Although, I think it’s definitely a place for women and children. None of the rides are scary, and it’s awful cutesy. Probably, the only one who reads this blog who will love the park is Meli (if you haven’t seen it, go, go now!).    For those of you who haven’t bothered going to the website.  urlLink www.bonfantegardens.com  Bonfante gardens is a theme park with an agricultural theme. The main/ first attraction was the circus trees which are really a bunch of trees grafted together to make shapes and stuff. Michael Bonfante made them himself, was the only one who knew how, and took the secret with him to his grave. This makes him a big jerk! And I don’t like him, I hope he’s spinning in his grave about the fact that paramount is running his park and selling their crappy souvenirs.  The kiddie ride part of the park is equally great. Most of the rides are food themed: artichoke, strawberry, apple, banana, garlic, mushroom… and unlike every other theme park in existence that makes all of their rides shiny like a carousel horse, many of these rides were matte. And they had very much attention to detail. Fine lines, shading. The artichokes even had the little pointy tip debossed and painted. It is also the first theme park that I’ve noticed artichokes being sold, granted they were deep fried, but still impossible to imagine being anywhere else. They had a pedal boat attraction, but of course it wasn’t a regular pedal boat, they were duck pedal boats. There were mallards, yellow ducks and swans and they looked so ridiculously adorable floating around the pond.   The strangest part about the park was the total laid back California attitude. You could pretty much do whatever and nazi teenagers wearing leiderhosen or old fashioned dresses weren’t around to stop you. They didn’t offer any instructions on how to drive the pedal boat ducks, they just slapped you in a life vest and sent you on your ducky way. The park was so uncrowded that most of the rides all you had to do was wait for the current cycle to finish and you’d get right on. They made sure you were safe and that your belts and bars were all correct, but somehow it seemed to be more laid back, and that made it run more smoothly. The only thing they were picky about was the 1 adult per strawberry car limit. Even though two of us could have more than safely been under the weight limit. And the words “please keep you hands and arms inside the car at all times” were heard so very little, it was refreshing.   Another great thing about the park is that there is a small mid-way section with games and over half of them involve you winning a prize just for paying your $3. This is how we almost ended up with a car full of stuffed toys, but last second managed to talk ourselves out of it. We did, however, come home with velvety plush roses with a bendy stem.   Conclusion: go, go, GO!	f

Sounds like you guys had a good time at Grand Master Flash. We definitely had a much quieter weekend.   I was very disappointed Thursday night. We lost, I did my toe again and didn't go to see Krush. I went to the doctor instead. So the night ended up costing me $110. $50 for 2 tickets and $60 for the doctor visit. It wasn't too bad I guess, I think the universe is telling me to slow down. I had to work the next day anyway and Krush will come here again... maybe in 2008. On Friday night I found that I had lost my CD with heaps of mp3s on it, felt disappointed for a while.   Spent more money on the weekend. I've got to control my spending. With the jerseys, bball, movies etc I've really gone off the rails. Matrix was good though. We have a theory but won't spoil it for the others that haven't watched yet. Talk about it later. I too missed the trailer for the 3rd movie. Will go to watch it again. Also saw DOnnie Darko and Ghost Ship. I though Donnie Darko was a really good film. Definitely creepy in parts. The guy who plays Donnie is also in Bubble Boy and Fresh says that I kinda look like him. Anyway what do you guys think happened. Did Donnie see a future timeline in the instant he woke up and choose to stay in bed or did he in fact go back in time to change history. One thing that doesn't make sense is the engine. The engine is the item which changes the space time continuum. If Donnie died by being hit by the engine, where did the plane come from. The plane doesn't fly out for another month. So the wormhole is still there. could it be that this timeline will revert again at the end of the month and begin again. Forming a loop. Anyway how !@#$ing creepy was the rabbit. Maybe the story isn't so strightforward and its an allegory for another idea. What do you guys think.  I also spent far too much time playing Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom. I tell you what, you let people out from under your thumb and they attack. Like Machiavelli says people don't rebel when the hammer is all the way down. The rebelling city states will soon taste my wrath.	f

twice in one day! i decided that it's high time to start seriously considering where i'm going to send my phd applications and start requesting information and application packages from those schools.  i remember all too well the chaotic hell that accompanied the process of applying for my ma.  trust me, i don't want to repeat it.  besides application deadlines seem to be getting earlier and earlier each year.  i'm also kind of worried that the same thing that happened in my ma applications will happen again: that i will neither have a choice where i go nor will i receive funding.  i realize it's kind of a silly fear, but i was told throughout my undergraduate year that (1) any school would be lucky to have me; (2) i should have no problem getting scholarship money.  neither of those predictions came true, and, although i'm happy at my current home -- or, at least, i think i'm in the right place, at least for now -- it was a blow (to both my confidence and to my debt load -- already too high) to receive only one offer of admission and no offers of funding.  besides, the words of a friend of mine keep echoing in my mind: that i've gotten my grades because i've given professors what they want to hear.  i'm not sure that's the case; at least i haven't tried to give profs what they want to hear, but the perception that that is a possibility worries me: if one of my closest friends here thinks so, who else does, and what are the people i'm not so close to saying about me behind my back. oh, screw this.  enough paranoid ranting for one day.	f
I just lived through the second hurricane of my adult life. In the first one, I was living in DC. It was 1999, and I blacked out in my apartment, so I had to go to Georgetown Medical Center for observation. My boyfriend at the time wanted me to come out to his place to ride out the hurricane. We had a huge fight since my mother wanted me to go to my uncle’s house in Maryland. I preferred staying with the boyfriend, but I did not want to worry my folks more than I already was worrying them. So off to the wilds of Northern Maryland I went. I don’t remember much, except that when I returned to campus, there were tree branches everywhere.  This time around, the hurricane missed us. It went up the gulf coast, and all we got was one storm at one-thirty in the morning on Friday morning. It was an amazing sight to watch. I was completely awe-struck by the power of nature. Still, it was just a really harsh storm and not the actual hurricane.  I did not see the fall-out of the hurricane until yesterday. My father and I went to a Muslim wedding. It was my father’s first Muslim wedding, and my second. The wedding was that of a cousin of mine…of sorts.  The true family connection is through the husbands of two of my aunts. These men are first cousins to the groom’s father. The family raised their children Hindu, but the groom had become a Muslim.  On our way to the wedding, my father and I conversed about my life. We talked about relationships, my siblings and my sister’s impending arrival in South Florida. I had been expecting cautionary tales, warning me not to turn out like my siblings. I get those about once a month from him. Instead, thanks in part to a mix tape with  Shania Twain  and  10000 Maniacs  on it, we made it to the wedding with no tears, and a few laughs.  I had never been at a wedding before, where I was afraid to talk to the men. I guess afraid is the wrong word. I was uncomfortable speaking with them. I offered my hand to the groom when I first arrived, and he refused it because I was a woman. I had dealt with that before, but usually with men of Arab decent and they are a lot more gracious about it. They understand that in the US men and women shake hands upon meeting each other. This guy looked insulted that I had offered him my hand.  I spent the wedding talking to the bride’s parents: a nice American couple from the Fort Myers area. They were having a hard time dealing with their daughter’s newfound faith in Islam. Still they were there to support her and her decision to marry a man she had met on the Internet.  Most of Fort Myers had no electricity or running water, including the mosque where the wedding was taking place. Before the wedding, my dad and I went to  Publix  to get a soda. The supermarket was crowded with people, but we were warned as we came in that there was no frozen food, produce or refrigerated items. So we enjoyed a warm coke and drove to the mosque.  The Imam was two hours late. This was the first wedding I ever attended where the reception occurred before the wedding. Everyone was roasting in the heat, since the interior of the mosque was even hotter than outside. There I sat, in heavy emerald green silk with tons of gold embroidery, feeling like I was the wicked witch of the west. The phrase, “I’m melting! I’m melting!” barely even covered the way I felt.  All around us were broken tree limbs and other debris. If I had not seen the intersections without signal lights, and the fact that even taco bell was closed, I would have thought that they had just experienced a bad thunderstorm. I saw some interesting angles for photographs, but realized the wedding party did not have a photographer. I used film on them instead.  Finally, the Imam showed up. He claimed he was late because he was stuck behind President Bush’s motorcade. They held the ceremony outdoors, so we didn’t die of heat stroke. If they had held it inside, I would have had to sit separately than my father. Since it was outdoors, we were allowed to sit together.  It was weird. In the other Muslim ceremony I witnessed, the bride opted to represent herself before God. In other words, she said her own vows. In this ceremony, the bride asked another gentleman from the mosque to recite her vows. So instead of the bride and groom holding hands, the groom clasped hands with this man, and the bride sat to the side looking a bit lost.  The ceremony itself was ten minutes. At the end of it, my father and I said our goodbyes and hopped into the car. I drove, and sped all the way to the other side of the state. On our way home, we stopped for barbecue. I ordered pork. I guess I’m never gonna be a good Muslim.	f

a whimsical semi-biographical tale  1997     Prologue   The amazement in my eyes Im sure is visible to anyone who notices me walking down the street. This was not what I knew of Chicago. I knew the poor, the filthy, the hungry. The people were mean and scary in themselves, without even making a move. Around them I felt like a thin wisp of lace at the edge of my memory, ready to crumple into nonexistence at the slightest touch or noise. But here on this street, amidst the lush green trees, the brick sidewalk, the blooming flowers carefully planted behind locked gates, and towering high rises with their noble residences, here I felt like a fine tapestry, protected and valuable, yet on display for all to regard its beauty. Here, walking down North Erie Street, I felt safe, guarded, and grown-up.      Chapter 1    It all began two months ago. Late at night, after working a long day at a boring desk job  clerical, mostly  I tried to relax by exploring the world outside my bedroom, using the phone as my connection to the vastness that constantly escapes me. On the computer screen before me, an ad flickered, changing. I usually dont even notice ads, because Im not interested, and even if I am, I dont have any money to buy anything. For some reason, though, the new ad caught my eye. Free 30 day trial. Tired of spending nights alone?	f
"... and other such bullshit.    Hey everyone. Sorry about the long gap in the blogging there. I was actually pretty busy this weekend. I saw ""I, Robot"" on Friday and Sunday (and will probably see it again sometime this week) and would really like to discuss it because the movie brings up some interesting questions. But I have more important things to talk about today.    Warning: today's blog entry will be vulgar. If cursing bothers you then you may as well hit your browser's back button now. I am fuckin angry and if you can't vent properly in your own blog then where the hell else can you vent?    I went out with Meridith on Saturday. I took her to a really nice restaurant here in Jersey called The Cheesecake Factory. So we go to dinner, we sit, we eat. We wound up having a really great conversation and losing all track of time. I got lost two times driving home 'cause we were still having this great conversation that I wasn't paying attention to where I was going. So basically I thought everything went great and that was the impression I got from her as well. My ability to read people apparently really fuckin sucks 'cause the next day I got a text message (a fuckin text message, mind you!!!) from her saying that she had a really great time and shit but only saw us as being friends.    What the fuck?!?!    Okay, before I go on let me make one thing clear. I'm not angry that Meridith turned out not to be interested in me. This was someone who was a blind date I don't really care that it didn't work out. Whatever. No, what is pissing me off is the pattern that is forming here. Prior to Meridith I went out once with a girl named Karen. Karen sent me an email the next day (better then a text message I suppose) saying that she wasn't interested. Again after what I thought was a really good date. So let's take a look at the pattern, shall we?    Going back through my previous relationships or attempts at a relationship: Meridith was a bitch, Karen was a bitch, Natalia was just crazy, Laura was just... crazy, Heather was just... well... crazy, Saxon was... umm... crazy. You get the idea.    So there comes a point where you have to stop and wonder is the problem really these women? Or am I the problem?    The evidence seems to suggest that the problem is me. I was always taught... nah, fuck that, I wasn't taught shit... I've always believed there's a certain way you're supposed to treat a woman. You're supposed to love them, and respect them, and treat them like they're worth their weight in gold. I am a stereotypical ""nice guy."" The kind that women are forever saying they want.    But the truth of the matter is they're all lying. Women don't want a ""nice guy"" that's not what they're attracted to. It's the ""nice guys"" who get told what great friends they are while the ""bad boys"" get taken to bed.    My boss gave me a few books to read by this guy named David DeAngelo. This guy writes about attraction. In these books he essential makes the case, a scarily convincing case, that women are not attracted to nice men. In fact, they are turned off by nice men. We've all seen women who are with these horrible men who treat them like shit and if you're anything like me you've wondered why. Well DeAngelo argues that it is these ""bad"" characteristics that are attractive to women. So DeAngelo says that if you want to attract women you should be cocky, you should make fun of them, tease them about something they are insecure about, make fun of other people, etc.    This approach is completely repulsive to me. But you know what completely disgusts me? This fuckin DeAngelo asshole appears to be right! Natalia always said I treated her better then anyone she's ever been with. But in the end she just wasn't attracted to me. Karen and Meridith both told me what a great guy I am, but in the end they just weren't attracted to me.    So I'm angry. Angry because I'm sick of being told what a great guy I am and then seeing the same woman with a complete asshole. I'm angry because everything I ever believed about how a woman should be treated is wrong! Fuck! As much as don't want to accept it, the evidence is overwhelming. Women just don't like the nice guys, they like the bastards.    So this is my lot in life. Either I change the way I treat women... become the type of guy that I hate so much, or live my life with all the female friends I could would, but no body who actually wants me.    Sorry for the angry rant. I'll be back to my old self tomorrow with a commentary on ""I, Robot."" Have a good night. I need to go find a fucking drink."	m
When Everyone talks and nobody listens The message is harder to hear If nobody bends, something gets broken And somebody pays with their tears If we never reach out,then no one comes in How can we change what is  What if we did what hearts are for Opened up every door We could be so much more What if we give more than we take What if we don't turn away We'll never look back and say,what if  If we were one road,how far could we travel And where would this journey lead If we were a mountain as tall as forever I wonder how far we could see If we only reach up and never look down A dream is as close as a wish   We try to find the answers beneath the wisdom tree When love alone will lead us to everything we need When we don't know where to go,maybe we already know	f
"I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch, and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing, one song, called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us. It's been through several arrangement changes, and everyone has had a feeling for sometime that this track was not quite there yet. So now, thanks to our newest addition Charles breathing new melodic life into the song by adding some new basslines, I was now ready to tackle Track 2 of the new Hypefactor album, which by the way, is the angriest, heaviest song HF has ever done, and will appeal to the few aggression fans who might pick this record up someday.  This song was intended to be our Primal Scream homage. And while it's still a nod to Booby G and co, I decided to loosen the reigns while molding this song into shape. Again, kudos to Charles for his solid work the other night. Because of him, I was able to blow this tune wide open. The track is very loop-based and repetative in nature, so I decided to go over all of these parts with a fine comb. Doing so, I found that these verses could be cut in half without losing the intensity of the song. Originally, the song opened with a quick POW, similar to the aggression's CHEMICAL SUN or Primal Scream's MISS LUCIFER, but after going through these loops, we found several loops and feedback guitar (and of course some of Charles' bass) that I loved and was able to turn these into a cool new intro . B and I agreed that the intro should remain loop based so when the song starts, the impact of the drums guitars will hopefully knock the listener on their ass. At least that is the intention.  During all this, Brandt's musical brain was working overtime and we tracked some new melodic guitars to put over the non-vocal verses. That nailed it as far as I was concerned.   And by the time it was over, 1956 had evolved into something new and exciting. It's in good enough shape for me to now lay down some vocals this coming week, but don't be surprised that once we have the vocals and live drums edited in that this song goes through another draft (mostly because there are so many loops that can probably be removed once Robin's drums are in). Not bad for a song that started 2 years ago with the aggression fooling around with laptops and guitars in my parents living room.  SPEAKING of the aggression, they will have a CD out in early 2005 featuring 14 (mostly unreleased) remixes from the course of their entire history. I'll get further into this as time progresses and details have emerged, but as Dan Hamill says ""Nostalgia is IN"". It is nice though to meet people who appreciate the aggression and their body of work and who want to hear more.  Keeping it old school I-Rock, The MOGpac at Skinny Puppy tomorrow and Monday, look for us. I'm the one with the beard (facial hair, not Ash)  F"	m
"My Decision, Mein Kampf   If you would have told me that a graduate with three majors graduating with top honors, a 90% on the MCAT, and 5 years of research would be rejected from every single choice school he wanted to go to I would have laughed outright in denial.  Denial is my reality.  I was always raised to think that doing your best and working your hardest would be rewarding, not only for your inner self but also for your future.  What I wasn't told was how all this depends on whether or not people will actually LOOK at what you have done.    Growing up I saw my share of racism with my family being from Iran.  Some were more gruism than others but you can never erase those memories and they motivated me to try to make a difference.  I never thought that I would experience a more subtle but equally degrading form of discrimination.  After performing poorly on the MCAT I was reject by over 20+ medical programs (I lost count after 20).  I retook the test relunctantly knowing that everything I had done was overshadowed by one stupid reading comprehension section.  When I got my new scores a great burden was lifted off my sholders.  I was in the 90th percentile and in science I was above that.  Surely this would mean that I would have a shot at my top schools for an MD/PhD program.  Surely places like UCSF, UCSD, and Stanford had to take notice.  I was right up there with them as far as everything.  The reality:  I didn't even qualify to submit a formal application to UCSF, Stanford told me that students like me infuriate them, and UCSD rejected me despite letters from two alums of that school.  I turned to the University of Washington, the only other school in West (where I wanted to be) that had the research I was interested in.  Indeed, 5 days after my interview I was accepted to the MD program.  Yeah right, the MCAT is just one factor.  Reality:  It is THE FACTOR!    I  anxiously waited for the news from the dual degree program.  My rejection came several months later with no reason.  The director said I should do research, perhaps try a summer research experience.  It was obvious my application as not ""looked"" at.  What else COULD I have done?  I'm only a recent undergrad; how can I have more than 5 years of research experience.  It was obvious that the thing at play here was merely where I was from.  Idaho = incompetence.  Need more evidence?  There has NEVER been an Idaho educated student accepted to that program, EVER.  I felt a feeling that I hoped I would never feel again, discrimination.  So, am I being overdramatic?  How would you feel having to wait 2 years to go to a school that wasn't at the top of your list, in a city you don't like, and to the wrong program!  I have a deskdrawer filed with over 40 rejection letters.  Did I have other choices?  Yes.  I got into 5 medical schools and 1 MD/PhD program.  However I have a specific area of interest and want to stay in the West.  Call it stupidity or ambition.  What does that leave me with?  I want a school that is established, has a program I want, and has some reputation.  I'm sick of being treated this way.  There was no ""choice.""  There was only one viable option.  The University of Washington is the anti-Albertson College.  It is almost the exact opposite of ACI.  The people treat you like a number, it is huge, and has a huge reputation nationally.  Alas my ""decision"" is to go to the University of Washington and reapply for the third year now to the MD/PhD program.  I guess it is irony because I don't like coffee, rain, or dogs.  But no need to worry I will spend my first day in the beautiful city of Moscow, Idaho.  I guess that's what I get for going to school in this state, having to stay even longer in it!  When I bump into numerous people they ask, ""So, are you excited to be going to medical school.""  How do I respond to something like that?"	m

Weep   It was fully worth it to go all this way to the library to check my mails. Its been very long since Ive gotten so many nice E-mails in one day.  Im touched. Thanx =)  Its raining. Seriously raining. And I just came from a shopping trip. Nothing seemed to work like I wanted it to this morning. I didnt really know what to do with the rest of my day, so I decided to go to H and spend some money.   I dont really like shopping. And H scares me a little bit. But, today, I was in the right mood and was quite successful, as well as actually having fun.   Things are fine.  My room has begun to look like its owner (colourful and a bit caotic), I have some food in the fridge, did laundry yesterday, am now formally a student at the university and tomorrow I will start my orientation course.  Im really looking forward to it. It will be nice to get to know some people and try to understand how this system works.   Its just cold and raining. Apart from that, everything is fine =)	f

Hosted by Karen Jaime For more info: Fish@louderarts.com  917-209-4211  Tribute Fundraiser for the Rev Pedro Pietri III info at nuyoricanhostess@hotmail.com  ******Following article is from Juan Gonzalez from the Daily News ****************   'El Reverendo' just not ready to leave pulpit     The sad news spread rapidly this weekend: Pedro Pietri, the king of Latino poetry in this town for more than 30 years, is suffering from inoperable stomach cancer.  And what a hilarious reign it has been.  Usually sporting a long black overcoat and a black bowler, with scraggly shoulder-length hair and mustache, Pietri, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1944 and served in the Vietnam War in 1967-68, sarcastically calls himself El Reverendo, the minister of the fictional Church of the Mother of All Tomatoes.  A typical Pietri poetry reading is somewhere between a vaudeville act and a Pentecostal revival. His audiences are erupting in laughter one moment and fighting back tears the next.  For those of us who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, Pietri's epic ""Puerto Rican Obituary"" - with its evocation of ""nervous breakdown streets/ where the mice live like millionaires/ and the people do not live at all"" - still remains the single most powerful expression of the Latino diaspora in this country.  Other Pietri poems, like ""Suicide Note from a Cockeroach in a Low-Income Housing Project"" and his extended series of ""Telephone Booth"" verses have been acclaimed as first-rate examples of urban street poetry and forerunners of today's rap or slam contests.  Pietri's prolific production includes more than 20 books of poetry and plays. His work has been translated into several languages.  His last performance was Nov. 8 at Town Hall, where he participated in the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the cultural center he founded on the lower East Side with playwrights Miguel Pinero and Miguel Algarin.  Three days after the Town Hall event, Pietri fell ill.  ""First I couldn't hold down any food,"" Pedro told me yesterday.  ""Then I couldn't hold down liquids. But being a hardhead, I thought it was just stomach ulcers. I didn't want to accept the truth.""   He finally checked into Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where doctors discovered a malignant tumor and immediately performed surgery. But by then the tumor had spread to his stomach.  Cancer is the latest and most serious of the physical maladies Pietri has confronted over the past few years.  Some, he is convinced, were caused by exposure in Vietnam to the herbicide Agent Orange.  ""When I was in the infantry in Vietnam, we used to see the planes spraying us with that stuff all the time,"" Pietri recalled.  For the first 20 years after his return from the war, his health was fine.  ""Then all of a sudden I came down with glaucoma, then with a bunch of skin diseases and now this cancer,"" he said.  His doctors are recommending radiation and chemotherapy to attack the tumor, but Pietri, always the cynical rebel, has rejected their approach.  ""They did what they could, but I don't want that radiation or to have them just cutting me up again,"" he said.  Instead he has decided to seek alternative medical treatment next month in Tijuana, Mexico, a procedure his health insurance carrier refuses to cover.  So last week his family and his friends at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe quickly established a benefit fund to pay for Pietri's treatment in Mexico. They are asking anyone who has enjoyed his poetry to come to his aid now.  Those wishing to help can send a contribution to the .   Pedro Pietri Health Benefit Fund,  c/o Nuyorican Poets Cafe, P.O.

There isn't a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes. My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom. He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.	f
Classes are really starting to burn me out. Six years of this shit, I have three weeks to go, and I'm almost willing to just stop now because I am absolutely losing my mind doing pointless group assignment after pointless group assignment. Don't get me wrong, I think I've learned a lot in college, but I'm to the breaking point of pretend life.   I stopped by and looked at a digital piano today. I can feel the music coming back to me now. As all of the frustrations and time consuming details of school are being released, along with the first taste of real freedom coming around the corner, I feel the motivation almost greater than that of high school. It's been 6 long years, but the music is coming back.	m

"It's late.  My husband is asleep, and I am so very lonely. I am so very, very lonely for the touch of a man, for the scent of a man, for the amazing feeling of a man next to me, on top of me, inside of me...  I slip out of bed, and tip-toe to the closet. I reach back, past my prim sweaters and blouses and dresses, to find it... The black skirt, the leather one that barely covers my ass. I slip off my wife panties and pull on my black thong, then step into the leather skirt. I exchange a black leather halter- the perfect mate of my skirt- for my night shirt, and step into my Manolo Blahnik stillettoes. I let my hair out of its ponytail, and brush it with long strokes, letting it spill over my shoulders and neck. A touch of red lipstick, and I am set. The transformation is complete.  The club is on the other side of town- nobody knows me in this place. I stride slowly through the crowd, trying to draw attention, and find my way to the bar. Some kid fresh out of college is tending bar, and I lean over the bar and wave to get his attention. He smiles at me, and hurries over. I try to pay for my Jack Daniels, but he waves the money away. I blow him a kiss.  On the dance floor a couple is standing, arguing. They're oblivious to all the motion surrounding them. Dancers spin and gyrate around them, but they just stand there arguing. Interesting. She's pretty, plump, and about his age, with short, dark hair and dark eyes. They're both younger than me by a few years, in their early twenties. He's gorgeous. His hair is closely cropped, and he's dressed nice in slacks and polished shoes and an expensive looking shirt. He's no punk. Finally, she pushes his shoulder and steps past him, headed for the Ladies' Room.  I leave my drink at the bar, and move towards him. He's still standing there, in a daze, and doesn't notice me until I'm right in front of him.  ""You look sad,"" I say. ""I hope it's not something I've done.""  He's confused for a moment, and replies, ""No, it's my girlfriend. We're just fighting about something stupid.""  ""My husband and I have the same kinds of arguments,"" I say. ""I am so glad he's not here right now.""  ""Where is he?""  ""Home, sleeping.""  ""What are you doing here?""  I smile, amused, and lean to him. I rest my arm on his shoulder and whisper in his ear, ""I'm looking for somebody to fuck.""  He laughs nervously for a moment, trying to determine if I'm joking. I'm not.  ""I think you're very sexy,"" I whisper. ""Why don't you take me home?""  He blushes, and stammers, ""I came with my girlfriend. I can't leave her here.""  ""Even better,"" I say. ""Let's bring her along.""  I tell him my name, and ask about them. He is Danny. She is Heather. They're engaged.  Heather arrives, looking none to happy to see me. Before any fun can happen, I need to get her on board.  ""Hi, Heather,"" I begin. ""I hope you don't mind me interfering, but I was just telling Danny to stop being so rude to you. If there's one thing that I've learned in my marriage, it's that no man should treat a woman that way.""  She laughs, confused by relieved.  ""Anyway,"" I continue, ""Danny and I were just talking about going back to your apartment and having some drinks, then sorting out this whole mess. Are you ready?""  Heather nods, completely shocked. I put my arm around her and tell Danny we'll follow him in my car. She'll ride with me. ""Time for the fun to start,"" I think to myself.  We settle into the car, and I compliment her outfit. She really does look hot. She's wearing jeans and a tank top. Her breasts are plump and firm, and she's got beautiful dark skin.  I question Heather about her relationship with Danny. It turns out they were fighting over one of his ex-girlfriends. She discovered he had been talking to the girl. ""The problem,"" I tell her, ""is that he's supposed to be jealous of you. We need to find a way to make HIM jealous.""  As I talk, I make it a point to gesture with my hands a lot, occasionally patting her arm or thigh. I want her to get comfortable with my touch. She tenses the first few times, but seems to relax over time.  We arrive at their apartment, and Danny pours us all a drink. I push him into an easy chair in the corner, and settle on the couch next to Heather.  ""Danny,"" I lecture, ""you're not giving Heather the respect she needs. You're not giving her the affection she needs. She tells me you don't even kiss her properly anymore.""  ""What? I kiss fine,"" he protests.  I turn to Heather, and gently caress her cheek. ""She's such a beautiful girl, Danny. You need to let her know that."" I lean to her, close my eyes, and kiss her softly. Our lips part just a little, and the tips of our tongues brush against each other for almost a minue.  ""That's how you kiss a beautiful girl, Danny.""  Danny looks down, unsure of what to say. Heather is staring at me, obviously wondering what I plan to do. I guess there's no reason to delay. I kiss her again, pulling her to me, my arms around her back and shoulders. She returns my kiss, our tongues pressing together. My fingers dance along her shoulders and back, glorying in the touch of her bare skin. I kiss her her ear, and her shoulders. She leans back her head, to give me access to her neck. I nibble gently on her throat and bosom, and her breath quickens.  ""Pay attention, Danny,"" I say. ""I'm going to show you how to make love to a beautiful girl.""  I reach for the bottom of Heather's top, and she lifts her arms without a word as I pull it over her head and toss it to the floor. She reclines on the couch, and I spread her legs. She hooks her left leg over the back of the sofa, and the other hangs onto the floor.  I begin with her stomach. I taste every inch of her torso, breathing in her sweet perfume, loving the texture of her warm dark skin. I nibble lightly on her breasts, small painless bites. She caresses my neck and shoulders and back, and runs her hands through my hair. I tease her nipple with my tongue, then take it into my mouth. I suck each nipple gently but firmly. She gasps with each suck, loving the sensation.  I trace my way back, and kiss her stomach while I open her jeans. She raises her hips to let me pull them off of her, and I do. Her panties are cute, small and black and silk. I take her hand, and slip it into the front of them. She closes her eyes, and begins to touch herself while I massage and kiss her thighs. She's lost in the pleasure, rocking against her fingers.  I glance at Danny, who is leaning back in the chair and rubbing his erection through his slacks.  ""She's beautiful, Danny. She's a beautiful sexy girl who just needs the right attention.""  Heather's fingers make a wet sound as she rubs her clitoris, and the pace of her rocking increases.  ""Watch, Danny. She's going to have an orgasm without you. She's going to cum, Danny, and she didn't need you to help.""  Just then, Heather climaxes, letting out a low moan as her back arches... I reach for her wrist, and slowly pull her hand from her panties. It is very wet, and I slip her fingers into my mouth, savoring the scent and flavor of her orgasm. She raises her legs to slip the soaked panties off, and I lay her hand back between them.  I stand, as she begins to masturbate again, and stand in front of Danny. He's still rubbing himself through the fabric of his slacks.  I step out of my heels, and remove my halter and skirt, so I'm standing in front of him in just a black thong. I glance back at Heather. She's lost in her own world, having orgasm after orgasm as she masturbates on the sofa.  ""Stand up,"" I bark at Danny. ""I'm going to teach you the right way to make love to a woman. I'm going to teach you how to fuck.""  He stands, and I order him to undress. He throws his clothes on the chair, and instinctively begins to stroke his hard cock.  ""Stop that, Danny. That's not for you, it's for Heather."" I lead him by the hand to the sofa. I bend over and kiss her on the cheek. ""Come on, cutie. Danny has something for you.""  She opens her eyes, and looks at him hungrily, like a wild animal who hasn't eaten in days. I help her to her feet, and guide her toward him. He wobbles on unsteady legs, but manages to embrace him in a kiss. His erection is pressing against her stomach, her breasts smashed against his chest.  They look at me, not sure how to proceed. I tell them both to kneel, then I help Heather recline on the floor. She is so beautiful, so sexy stretched out in front of me. I want to make love to her for hours, I want to taste every atom of her body, but I hold back. This is Danny's treat.  ""Go on, Danny,"" I say. ""Explore her. She's so sexy. Learn every inch of her body.""  I lie back on the couch and watch them. He licks and nibbles on her calves and thighs while she touches herself. He massages the muscles in her legs, before finally lowering himself to her wetness. He goes down on her, and she reacts instantly. She must be so sensitive, after nearly a dozen orgasms. I slip out of my thong, and begin to caress my nude breasts and stomach and pelvis. He attacks her clitoris with complete abandon. His face is wet. She cums, and cums again, wave after wave of orgasm engulfing her. I reach between my legs, and find myself very wet, my labia swollen with desire.  Danny looks at me, unable to think for himself. He is soaked with her sweet, wet perfume. ""Make love to her, Danny,"" I say. ""Fuck her, but slowly. Savor her. She's so beautiful.""  Danny rises between her legs, hovering over her, then enters her slowly, bit by bit. Heather moans softly, spreading herself wide to receive him. He thrusts in a slow rhythm, and she pulls her knees toward her shoulders, opening herself for him. They are gorgeous. Her, beneath him, legs clenched, breasts swollen and aroused, eyes closed, mouth open, gasping with each thrust of his cock, her fingertips digging into his back, pulling him into her. Him, inside her, his wonderful young ass tight as he pushes himself inside her. Sweat covering their bodies. Lost in each other. Lost in the desire.  Their fucking intensifies, quickening. Danny is on the brink of orgasm. I am wet and overcome with arousal. I am going to cum, but not this way. Not alone.  I stumble off the sofa and crawl to them. I kneel beside Danny, and bend to his back. I kiss it gently, then kiss his buttocks. Then, wanting him, needing him, I bite him roughly on the ass. He moves more quickly, fucking, fucking, fucking Heather. I wrap my arms around his waist, and pull him, forcing him away from her. He tumbles to the floor, and I take his place between her legs. Heather grabs the back of my head, and pulls me to her wetness. I devour her, pressing tongue and lips against her sweet, wet clitoris.   She screams. ""Ohhhhh, yessss, ohhhhhhhh.""  Danny is behind me now, He seizes my hips in his hands, and quickly, roughly forces himself inside me. Such a great cock, so big and so hard. I move in rhythm with his thrusts, raising my ass and hips to meet his push, while Heather bucks and moans beneath me. This is Heaven. This, the taste of a beautiful girl on my wet lips and the cock of a gorgeous young man inside me, is Heaven. My breasts bump against the floor, and it hurts, but I love it.  Heather's body rocks with ecstasy and she struggles for breath. Danny fucks me, faster, faster, faster, and I can tell he's going to cum. ""Yes, baby, fuck me. Cum for me, Danny, cum for me!""  He thrusts again, pulling me onto his cock with all his strength, and his body shakes as my orgasm meets his. His hot cum fills me, and covers my pussy and thighs and runs down my leg.  We collapse, the three of us, naked and spent and covered in sweat and semen, and sleep until morning..."	f
I've got the outfit for the wedding now.  Went to the bullring with J from school.  Had a great time.	f
O. I was sick from school today. Fun times. That's all. Nothin'....	f
Pleasure   To overcome my stupid depressive thoughts. I figured I need to get myself organised. Came out with a list of things to do.   1. Save. Seriously, put aside money per month and use it on rainy days.  2. Take a roll of pictures per month and get them developed. Taking pictures make me happy. 3. Treat my parents to a movie/dinner to somewhere new per mth.  4. Get that blardy car license soon. Either that, or to sit the IELTS english paper and pass it and get my arse outta of Singapore. 5. Watch a movie per week.  6. Write at least an entry per week on the blog.  7. Make good use of that gym membership that I have been neglecting. Lose that weight really.   That's quite a bit. Hope to stick to it eventually.   I got 6 pending rolls that need development. Hope the pictures will turn out well. Hope my pay will check in real soon. Sheeesh. Nite.	f
My history test is over and done with.  We can just leave it at that.  Although I don't think I did exceptionally well (it has never taken me the full exam time to complete a test before this one), I am fairly certain that I at least passed.  In other news, I began to unwind from this horrible week by going to tonight's Bruins and Rangers game.  It was, as usual, a lot of fun!   urlLink Gonchar  scored his first goal as a Bruin, and good old Joe got the other two red lights tonight.  The people watching was at its prime- there are so many entertaining imbeciles there to pass the time (and the nachos aren't terrible, either).  Hockey seems to make me feel better- Vinnie's proposal includes one hockey game a week to relieve stress.  If he finances this method of treatment, I won't be too opposed!  I can begin collecting the souvenir cups- you can never have too many!  Hopefully spring break will make me feel better.  I got approval to stay in my dorm for the week.  I figured the office of residence life and housing might as well approve something, since I didn't get the RA position.  No big deal, I can have more time to myself and less time detracted from my studies and other such ventures.  Spring break has commenced and I am, once again, free!  The man can't hold me down anymore!!!  Okay, gotta go to bed- work tomorrow morning at 8!  Later.  *me*	f
One thing is certain. We can't ignore him. If these moments are factual, if the claim of Christ is actual, then he was, at once, man and God.  The single most significant person who ever lived. Forget MVP. He is the enitire league. The head of the parade? Hardly. No one else shares the streets. Who comes close? Humanity's best and brightest fade like dime-store rubies next to him.  Dismiss Him? We can't. Resist Him? Equally difficult. Why would we want to?  Don't we need a God-Man Savior? A just-God Jesus could make us, but not understand us. A just-Man Jesus could love us, but never save us. But a God-Jesus?   NEAR ENOUGH TO TOUCH. STRONG ENOUGH TO TRUST. A NEXT DOOR SAVIOR              FROM THE BOOK NEXT DOOR SAVIOR He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!	f
"Hello everyone!      I am posting this as a warning to all of you, who may be thinking of purchasing something from the Internet at any time. This is not spam, and is entirely from my own experience. The details in this story are facts, and happened to me over this last week. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone you'd like; this is meant to serve as a warning, and hopefully to prevent you from having horrible customer service, like I have.      Over the last week, I've been browsing the Internet for a certain pair of speakers, Harmon Kardon Soundsticks (USB version). These have been discontinued by HK, but are still available online. I did some searching, and saw that not only did Buy.com list them at the lowest online price ($165), but included free shipping. Because Buy.com's warehouse is located only a few hours north of me, it should take only a day of in-route shipping to get here.      Before ordering, I sent them an e-mail on Wednesday to try and find out if they were new-in-box or refurbished speakers. After not getting a response by Friday, I figured I'd bite the bullet and take a chance; after all, I wanted the speakers either way.      I placed my order at 10:30am PST (1:30pm EST) on Friday; Buy.com's web site states that in-stock items usually ship same day if ordered by 4:30pm EST (1:30pm PST) - I obviously met this requirement. I checked their website around 4pm PST, to see if it had shipped. It was listed as being ""Sent to Warehouse"". As you guys know, companies sometimes take a while to update their websites and with the weekend, I wasn't overly concerned.      Monday rolls around, and I still haven't gotten a shipping confirmation e-mail, and their website still listed my order as ""Sent to Warehouse"". I sent Buy.com an e-mail through their website asking for a status update. (Side note: Still no reply to the first e-mail I sent on Wed.) I went to school and didn't get a chance to think about it further until the afternoon. Around 3pm, there was still no update via e-mail or website. I attempted to find a phone number on their website to call, but there was none - at all. I thought this was odd, and tried a Google search for their contact information, which turned up nothing. I decided to do a WHOIS search on their domain, and got a phone number through that. But, it was past 5pm now, and I waited to call until Tuesday.      Tuesday morning, still no new information on my order. I called the number, and got over to an order representative. She informed me that the speakers I wanted were on ""surprise backorder"", and had been for over two weeks. (Surprise backorder? Was there suddenly a rush on discontinued 2 year-old USB-based speakers?) They had no ETA as to when they might come in stock. But wait, doesn't their website list them as in-stock? They sure do - and the lady had no idea why. Why was I not informed of their stock status before, during or after placing my order? She had no idea, and apologized. I was upset at this point, mostly for wasting nearly 4 days waiting for speakers they didn't have, but decided to see what other Internet retailers had the speakers, and simply take my business elsewhere.      5 minutes later, I checked eCost.com, and found they had them for only $169.99; not too much more, and they also had free shipping. I called the phone number CLEARLY shown on the top of their web site, and confirmed they were in stock. I placed my order, and less than 15 minutes later, was very happy again. I decided to call Buy.com and cancel my order. Upon getting a hold of a customer service rep, she kindly took my request to cancel the order.      Fast forward to 3:30pm PST. My order from eCost.com has already shipped, and should be here tomorrow (Wednesday). Then I get an e-mail from Buy.com. It seems that ""Unfortunately, this item has already entered the fulfillment process and we were unable to cancel it."" Wait - how has it entered fulfillment? They can't ship or bill me, because they don't have the product. And they have no ETA on getting the product; so how can they not cancel the order? (Keep in mind, they have an authorization charge on my credit card for the speakers; their policy, however, is not to complete the charge until the item ships.) I call them once again, and the customer service rep informs me that she cannot just cancel the order; they have to e-mail a ""request to cancel"" to another department. Wait, what? How does that make sense? You take the order, you can cancel the order. Who does business like this? At this point, I'm getting upset and ask to speak to a supervisor.      A supervisor finally gets on the line and insists that he can't do anything. I grill him about their policies and how they operate for nearly 30 minutes, but he still only apologizes and says he can't do anything other than e-mail this other department. When I asked about this department, he confirmed they were in the same building - but he couldn't call them OR physically go there to them. I ask to speak to his supervisor; he's the ""most senior person on duty"". When asking for anyone higher, there's no one there. Now he's really pissing me off. I ask him how his company can operate by lying to customers, stealing their money and then ignoring them. Still nothing but apologies and ""we can only send a request to cancel the order"". I remind him that one request has already been refused, and ask what will be different this time around; he has no answer.      Fine; let's sumbit another request. How long will this take? ""You shold have a reply to the request in 3-5 business days."" Wait, what the hell? Not a cancellation - a reply; they can simply say NO again. And I have to wait 3-5 business days for this? Now I'm pissed; and as most of you know, you don't piss off a Heltsley. ;) I tell him to send the request, and tell him that his company sucks and hang up.      I call back, get the operator and ask for their legal department. After the transfer, I find that most everyone has gone home (it's near 5pm PST now), but the lady there takes a message and promises someone will get back to me within 24 hours. At this point, I reply to their ""refusal to cancel"" e-mail and re-iterate that I want my order cancelled, now. I also call my credit card company, but they can't block the charge approval; they tell me to refuse the item if it does get shipped to me and then call them back, and they'll get my money back.      So, here I am. Lied to by website, ignored via e-mail, and money stolen by a company with questionable business practices. So I do what any American does - tell everyone he knows never to buy from them again. As most of you have worked in retail at one point or another, you know the saying: An angry customer tells 10 friends never to shop there again. Well, I'm letting you know and asking you to pass on the story (in whole or part, your choice) to anyone you know. I know it won't really hurt their business, but if I can prevent any of my friends from suffering as I have, I'll feel better.      I'll feel better after having a chat with their legal department tomorrow, as well. ;)   - John"	m
Today: Early Out! oh yah. So then I went to Kinky's house with Travis to take apart our RG. We've been putting that off for like 5 weeks, and it took us around 5 minutes to do. So then we killed about 4 hours at Andrew's house. We drove around, walked around, I tried to ride his bike in a skirt (haha), played poker (or tried), played spit (and lost to Travis), and then we played BS (btw, Andrew isn't very good jk lol). So after watching Andrew blow up 2 peanut cans with a gun we went to the movies.  Well, none of us are 17, I'm the oldest, I'm 15 lol. We wanted to see Dawn of the Dead. So I tried to pretend I was 17. Unfortunately, that didn't work. So then we got tickets to see Walking Tall. We got there, and I really didn't want to see it so then Andrew asked the front desk if we could switch to Scooby Doo 2.... (sad... we know) So we went to Scooby Doo 2, and we were the only ones laughing. I swear we enjoyed it more than these little kids lol. Of course, if we'd been smart at the beginning we would have bought tickets to Hellboy, which was right next to DotD and then gone into that one. But no... We just couldn't think that fast.  Oh well, Luv u all lotz n lotz, ~*Phileda*~	f
"At age thirteen, when I invited friends over, I'd tell them: ""Self-service!""  I wasn't a very good host.  I remember someone being shocked when I came back from New York and was actually serving her drinks like a semi-proper host.  I was the family baby in Malaysia. When guests came, my elder sisters did all the drink-serving and small-talking. Everyone just told me to get out the way.  It was only in New York, when Mom had to rely solely on Adik and I, while entertaining guests, that I picked up the skills of a host. So, while Mom planned the party and entertained the guests, Adik and I made sure the food and drinks were continuously available, and I even picked out poor lone-wolf guests and brought them into Mom's fold.  I enjoy the running of a party. There's so many balls to juggle, and it's fun to juggle them.  But I have yet to master  planning  a party. Me and plans don't do very well. I'm more a trouble-shooter. If we're suddenly out of Coke, I'll suddenly pop up with a solution. But to figure out how much Coke we'll actually need?  Erm, why don't we all just go clubbing?"	f

"Tossing and turning, I get up and realize that I need to clip my left hand fingernails to prepare for praise night's heavy duty guitar playing.  Currently I await my rommate to finish hhihs shower so that I can enter the bathroom and get the nail clippers.  After the last post I laid in bed, tossing and turning.  I got up, and went through the set list again.  I realized there were too many songs, I took one out.  That's when I noticed my long fingernails on my left hand were hampering my fingers from properly form the chords.  They weren't that long, just long enough to make a difference, maybe one and a half millimeters long.  Tomorro is Wednesday.  A day of much preparation to brring a lot of stuff home.  A day in which I will determine myself to make a difference in my life instead of passively letting my flesh and its fears freeze me into falling into the same pattern again.  Snow is falling outside.  My roommates take a break from their bout of Mario Tennis to note the layer of snow that has already formed.  Winter is here, already.  Seasons change, but do we?  I apologize, Dee, for all that commotion on your site.  It's my fault, and I want to make it up to you somehow.  Even if it is a small thing.  It's how we handle the small things that indicate how we handle the big things, right?  My roommates are getting more into their Mario Tennis Match.  I sit here typing, eyes closed, in my stream of consciousness, connecting, waiting for the next significant thought to appear.  Strong Bad, on the Homestar Runner site, noted in a recent email cartoon that ""the Internet is place where nothing happens, nothing.""  I agree with him.  To a certain degree.  Smalville episode was interesting today.  Kristin Kreuk seems to be the main draw for everyone I know that is hooked on the show.  Me?  I watch the show because I was into comics as a kid, and it's interesting to see the plot twists and turns.  Kristin is quite attractive, but that's such an impersonal medium.  Since friends started to idolize celebrities in the 5th grade, I sometimes bought into the whole ""ogle the celebrity female"" thing, but not much.  When I entered puberty, it became more of a physical thing, but I never really went crazy about obsessing over some stupid celebrity like I noticed many other guys did.  I noticed the girls around me, and was more content about finding interest in them, because they were real, and they were fun to talk to.  Since then, it's been the same.  I don't really care to admire celebrity females, because my heart doesn't buy into the cultural definition of beauty.  Well, to a certain extent.  It tends to fantasize more about girls I've met.  don't take that the wrong way.  fantasize as in, smitten, as in, admiring beauty.  my roommate is done his shower.

Mr Vorilhon, who calls himself Rael, claims a space alien visiting him in 1973 revealed that extraterrestrials had created all life on Earth through genetic engineering."", excerpt from Straits Times, Thursday,June 24 2004, article on  ""Cloned baby? Science shows its snake oil.""  For what I feel, this guy is definitely a crackpot to me. Having seen an extraterrestrial is strange enough, having spoken to one and even being able to speculate on issues of mankind is seriously out of this world. I wonder why they still allow him to continue his theory on such inane claims, they should put him in a mental asylum if you ask me.  ""In a not-too-distant future, advanced cloning technologies will allow us to even recreate a deceased person in an adult body, with all his past experiences and memories, allowing mankind to enter the age of immortality as it has been announced by His Holiness Rael founder of Clonaid, in 1973 alread, after his contact with the Elohim, mankind's extraterrestrial creators,"" the company said.  They seem to be trying to create another 'The 6th Day"", which remains as a scientific fantasy. I am not surprised that they were met with great scepticism, for they seriously need some polishing to work on with their minds to be able to believe in Mr. Vorilhon."	m
"Keith Barton, a magician in Hueytown, Ala. with Mississippi ties, received national attention after Matilda, a 14-year-old chicken featured in his magic act, was officially named the ""World's Oldest Living Chicken"" by Guinness World Records.  Barton was born at Keesler Air Force Base, grew up in Gulfport and graduated from Harrison Central. His father, James Barton of Orange Grove, still lives in South Mississippi.  During the ""Mort the Mystifying"" magic show, Matilda's role is to appear in a pan that contained only an egg yolk and some hot sauce moments earlier. Barton's wife, Donna, is also in the act as the magician's assistant.  Matilda has practically doubled the lifespan of a normal chicken, which is 7 or 8 years. Matilda has never laid eggs and is very pampered, and Donna Barton said she believes both contribute to Matilda's long life.  The Bartons began performing their magic show in 1989 for children at libraries and churches. In July 1991, Matilda made her magic show debut.  Barton is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians, International Brotherhood Of Magicians and Ring 35 (Judge Arnold Drennen Ring) of Birmingham. He has extensive training in magic, including completion of the home-study course offered by Chavez College Of Magic in Los Angeles. He also spent a year mastering the Chinese Linking Rings, which are one of his signature routines."	f

My last Sunday night at the hotel. My last night at the hotel.  The housekeeping ladies threw me a small party with a cake. I had no idea I was so loved . . . as a group they hate the hotel management and I habve never really bothered to hide my contempt for the owners of this place, and as such, they have always appreciated my barbs towards the higher ups.  mad props were thrown all 'round . . . in an almost haphazard, willy-nilly fashion  now there is less than two hours left in my sentence and I can go back to  enjoying my Sunday nights . . . . I have an entire season of Simpsons to catch up on now.    Then, Graduation.  I'm not too sad, but it will hit me when I'm in Toronto and lonely - not so much for the individual people that I'm leaving behind here at Queen's, but for the lifestyle that I have experienced as a 19 to 24 year old.   For instance: last Tuesday, Bob (my housemate) and I threw a kegger. Bob  bought a keg of Keith's and refused to charge admission for it. Free Beer. (Bob works three jobs, two of which are merely titles right now, but he gets paid quite well - it's a long story involving our third housemate who moved out in December and far too boring for this piece of the Internet) Anyway, the beer was just Bob's way of having a good time.  And a good time was had!!!!  We had a ton of people over and drank about a third of the keg (we had a  further get together Friday night for hockey and partially-flat Keith's) and anyone there could not have cared less about the next day. I played an acoustic set of music with my lead singer in the living room and was in heaven for an evening.  It's evenings of the like that I will miss when I'm stuck at home in my parent's house in June. The Complete and Utter Lack of Responsibility. Friends who live - at maximum - ten minutes away and we only need a designated driver if we're going to steal shopping carts from the A across the street.  Strangers that become formal dates that become 'sleepover friends' all in the span of an evening.  Walkinbg up to a friend's door unannounced and knowing that a) the door will be unlocked b) you're always welcome c) it's 3 a.m. on a Tuesday and  all their lights are on.   I can't really describe what it has been like going to school here at Queen's, but it really is it's own self-contained community. It gets knocked for that reason yet I have loved just about every moment (well, barring a month here and there) that I've been able to spend at it. It really is a world unto itself and I've been lucky enough to take advantage of so many opportunities that it has thrown my way.  I'm happy I'm here. I'm happy to have been here. I'm going to miss the atmosphere. Just about anything could happen on any given day.  blargh  ajc	m

Here's a luxury competition spoiler-  Will (along with Drew and Diane) won a screening of  Without a Paddle  last night.   -End of spoiler.  Sadly, what Spamgirl has reported is indeed true- it's starting to look like Will's days are numbered... :(  Granted, they (The Twin Alliance) are still discussing possibly putting up Karen or Nakomis in place of Marvin to really break up the alliance, but for now, things aren't looking too bright for Will- as things stand now, he could pull off a 3/3 tie (with Karen, Nakomis, and Diane voting for him to stay), but that would leave the tie breaker with Adria...  (The twins know Diane is playing Nak/Karen/Will and have accepted that she will vote with them)  It's interesting to note that Will seems to think Drew will never vote him out- let's hope that holds true!  Stranger things  have  happend (Remember Adria vs. Holly?  Whodathunkit? :D)	f

Terminator 3 was pretty mediocre... it's even more surprising now that I've seen it that Arnold won the election so soon after that movie. It wasn't bad, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it either. Hopefully Once Upon A Time In Mexico will be better.  I'm on another downloading blitz. Barenaked Ladies' new album, Everything To Everybody, is pretty damn good so far. I've been using Friendster to find people with similar musical tastes to my own and seeing what else they like. So far I've gotten Guster (good) Flaming Lips (so far so good) Badly Drawn Boy (ok) and some other stuff that was crap and I deleted it already and don't even remember what it was. I'm also getting some stuff from Ben Folds Five and The Smiths that I haven't listened to yet. So I'll have to revise my playlist again sometimes soon to incorporate some of this new stuff. I forgot to add Coldplay and Evanescence last time too.  Now if I can just figure out some reason to leave the house... there's bloody nowhere to go around here.	m
"Updates and Lil' Tidbits   Back in action!  1)Yesterday was my first doctor's appointment in the last 8 years.  I mean, I've BEEN to the doctor since then, but I now have a real doctor in the city that's all my own.  It feels GREAT to be an adult for once.  The check up went perfectly.  He said that I am in excellent health.  The only bad thing he noticed was that I have a slight tremor (I was unable to touch my nose with my eyes closed).  He said that it may be caused by my quitting smoking or by not eating breakfast yesterday morning.  Either way, he's going to monitor it over the next couple of months to make sure it's not something serious.  BTW, I can touch my nose with my eyes closed now that I'm out of the office.  Figures.  2)My anniversary with Paul was wonderful!  His gift to me was perfect.  He bought us two handmade silver rings from a jewelry designer ( urlLink Jill Platner ) in the city.  They are beautiful rings.  On the inside of mine it says ""APG loves JHC, 1/9/2004"" and his says ""JHC loves APG, 1/9/2004"".  We are both wearing them on the middle finger of our right hand.  I was very moved by the gift.  After this, Paul took us out to dinner at  urlLink Lupa's  and we had a great dinner.  The wine was SO good and the food, although it was gourmet style and looked foo fooish, was excellent.  The whole night was memorable.  3)I didn't end up doing the five senses gift.  I am running VERY low on money and was unable to buy him a gift this year.  Instead I remodeled his bedroom.  I decorated it, organized it, and whipped it into shape.  He was VERY excited and happy with the gift and I saved me some extra pennies, which I am in desperate need of.    4)For Mariah's Christmas gift, I overhauled her bedroom too.  I wish you could see it.  In the 4 years I have been friends with her, Mariah has never had an organized, clean bedroom.  Now she does.  I told her that I would be giving weekly inspections to make sure it stays that way.  And I'm serious.    5)On Friday night we went out to Splash Bar.  I think everyone had a blast.  I know I did.  BUT, there was one rough moment.  There were these three middle aged queens hanging out in the bathroom at the same time we were and they would not leave Mariah alone.  I pulled her away from them and they got pissy.  I then asked them to leave us alone as we didn't want to hang out with them.  This one guy got really angry and called me ""bald"", which I didn't like very much.  I then told him that he was an ""ugly 50 year old man that is obviously spending his night alone"".  He didn't like that very much and grabbed my shoulder.  Now, I do NOT like when people put their hands on me and I tend to turn into a huge psycho.  I started telling him to ""remove his fucking hands immediately"" and he kept pushing me and rubbing my head.  Eventually the bouncer came over and asked me if this loser was bothering me.  I said yes and proceeded to walk with the bouncer to the entrance.  Fuck head got BOUNCED right out the bar.  I felt so powerful and dared all of my friends to mess with me.    6)My brother is being nominated for a  urlLink Bronze Star !  Read up on it to find out more.  My family couldn't be more proud.  7)I saw  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  last night.  I must say, this trilogy is by far my most favorite trilogy ever.  I could watch it over and over and over.  The last installment is surely Oscar worthy and will prove that point once the Academy Awards roll around.  I won't give anything away, but dammit, it is rare to see a movie of such caliber.  Thank you  urlLink Peter Jackson  for directing this masterpiece.  8)Ari informed me that there is a new remake of  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  coming.  She showed me the trailer while we were at work on Friday and I still can't get it out of my head.  FUCKING YAY!  9)I had one cigarette on Friday night.  I caved and had it all by myself in my bedroom.  I haven't had a single drag since and am still quitting the smokes, but I did cave once and thought I should be honest about it.  Unfortunately, the Nicotine patch is giving me a horrible case of insomnia.  I have to try removing it before bed tonight to see if that helps.  I'm barely surviving on 6 hours of sleep  for the last 3 days.  That should be it.    I have rehearsal tonight.  We found a space for our February AIDS benefit.  I am really excited that this is moving forward.  I have to memorize another script during my lunch break today and I should be ready to go.    Now, if only I could get myself an agent and make some money doing this acting thing.  That's my next goal and it couldn't come sooner.    Happy Stupid Tuesday!"	m
This week was undoubtedly one of the most hectic weeks for the past 2 or 3 months. Almost every evening i was meeting my house broker to see various houses. I finally decided on one house this thursday. Its pretty much sufficient for one guy ;) .. with a good bedroom, hall and kitchen and ofcourse the bathroom. Its on the first floor, near a park, in a very silent lane [ except for a couple of dogs i guess ;) ]. The only thing new for me now, is to learn to stay alone :-(, with my earlier room-mates shifting to separate houses. It was such a pleasure living with them. I hope to keep meeting with them often even after we start living separately.  Every eveving, I had to rush to catch hold of this broker since he usually is not available otherwise. They are so much in demand these days in Bangalore. On the weekend, when i actually met my new house owner, the broker had another customer literally sitting on his head asking him to show him some house he promised. The owner seems to be a nice guy and i hope to not have much problems. The best thing about this house is that the owner stays about 25 kms away from my new house. I am sure its one real good thing that made me decide on this house.  As if this was not enough, our test engineer for Evolution Exchange connector, suddenly woke up from his slumber and started filing bugs left right and center. The bug count dramatically rose up [ which was quite expected if anyone tested the component ;) ]. But, unfortunately, most of the bugs were very rare case scenarios or negative test cases and not so interesting to fix apart from a few good ones. I have started working on those interesting bugs for now. One very interesting bug is that, if i get a task forwarded as an ics file and i accept it, evolution hangs. Well, that was what the bug said, but my RedHat 9 box, had a pretty different story to tell me. Whenever, i tested this bug, it was just not evolution, but the whole machine that was getting locked up. I could see the CPU being hogged [ the CPU red light was glowing continously ], and no keyboard inputs were being accepted. I tried a ssh to my machine from another test box, but that also timed out. Was very annoying to have to reboot my machine after it being up and running for a month :-(. To gather more info about this bug, i left it hanging in the evening and came back in the morning and saw that the machine had reached some sanity and was recognising the keystrokes, but was nevertheless damn slow. So, i have decided to debug this on the tester's machine itself ;)  Before i forget to mention, there are a few very nice blogs written by  urlLink fejj  which i would like to mention here. One is on  urlLink profiling tools , another is on  urlLink effective searching  and a follow up of this on  urlLink binary search trees . These are all quite elementary in nature, but i liked the approach in which he explains this. And as he later points out, there is a wealth of knowledge on different tree implementations at  urlLink http://www.msu.edu/~pfaffben/avl/   This week is gonna be another busy week, and i am planning to do some reading too :-) Hope i am able to balance my time between hacking and reading.	m
"Okay wow, Macs piss you off.  And I don't know why.  But they do.  After receiving some post WWII era Macs (no pun intended, seriously, they run 33mhz at top speed), I think these might have been the Nazi Party's secret weapon.  And think about it, its genius!  To develop ""boxes"" with TV screens and an advanced recording system that somehow plays a series of scenes on the TV screen, fooling the user that they actually bought a working computer!  After a while, the user gets enraged at this machine since it does absolutely nothing.  Also it has eye-burning colors that just suck.  After repeated attempts to operate the Nazi TV Box, the user becomes angry and punches it in the screen, which would electrocute him and he would die.  Now all the Nazis had to do was mass-produce them in a wide variety of colors and sizes, and then to put them onto the market at reasonable prices, and you have the Macintosh corporation.  Pure genius...."	m

"I can't be alone in the world wishing that Robert Winston would shut up. His recent  urlLink outburst directed towards Prince Charles  has just made me dislike him even more.  I happen to think that Prince Charles is great at raising public and political awareness about issues. Let's face it, the man has a lot of time and resources at his disposal to enable him to actually research these areas that concern him and many others. Besides anybody who tries to make a bit of trouble for greedy politicians is alright by me. I know he gets it a bit wrong sometimes, but generally I think he's right to make people sit up and listen. In the  urlLink Indie article  he explains that it is nanoparticles that really concern him (and not robots) and I for one think he's right in asking for more research into the effects of such compounds. The effect of using nanoparticles in contact with the skin may be very different from ordinary sized particles. I think the point is here that we just don't know, and a real effort to reassure people with facts is required. Winston's and other people's reactions to Charle's opinion doesn't help the situation. This kind of attitude is precisely what makes people suspicious in the first place.  Scientists must be able to justify what they do, and it mustn't be a case of ""we  can  do it, so we  will  do it"""	f

"I'm heartened to know there are Singaporeans who believe that money isn't everything. I hope that I never forget that... Of course, there are those also those who believe that money is progress, like the other letter-writer in today's forum page. And he quotes LKY too:  ""My point to Mr Stefansson is that if one stops striving to achieve more, to be better than one is now, to set a higher target once the target is reached, one has stopped progressing.  Why do you think Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is exhorting Singapore not to rest on its laurels and stay at 30,000 feet? He thinks that Singapore can and should climb to 36,000 feet."" - - PETER TEO BOON HAW  Exactly. WHY? Mr Teo, progress for the sake of progress, is why Singapore is the way it is today, a place with no respect for the past and no sense of the present. We are obssessed with better. We are obssessed with new. So much so that one of our  tabloids - more than a decade old - is called ""The New Paper"".  An apt name, come to think of it - one which describes Singaporean mentality. Building too small? Tear it down! Replace it with something bigger, something better, something new. Nevermind that the building is still in perfect working order. Nevermind that the building holds memories dear to Singaporeans. Nevermind that renovations were just carried out a few years ago. Why have pseudo-new when you can have a brand new, bigger, better building? Progress? Mr Teo, think hard about why Singaporeans are so depressed nowadays. I say it's because we've been told - no, ordered - that staying at 30,000 feet is not progress, Not good. Ironic that he quotes Ben Franklin saying, ""Who is rich? Someone who realises he has enough.""  Maybe we should realise that we have enough. We complain about not having things to do when the reality is that the weekend comes and we are too tired to do anything. Why? Progress. We have to, we must, climb to 36,000 feet... then 50,000 feet. And then we'll finally reach the outer limits of our atmosphere. Suddenly, we'll realise that we can't breathe and that we're about to - literally - burst.  Easy for a professional bum to say all this though... right? As I said at the start, I hope my belief that money is not everything holds even after I enter the working world.   urlLink Is chasing after money good or bad? - The Straits Times, Forum Page, FEB 5, 2004   (Start of copied text) ---------- I APPLAUD Mr Paul Stefansson for dispensing very wise advice at the start of a new year in his letter, 'Money, money, it's a rich man's woe' (ST, Jan 31).  After the momentous events of the past few years, one has to realise that, at the end of the day, there is more to life than chasing money.  While my peers and my husband's moved from Housing Board flats to condos, we remained in our HDB flat. While our friends moved on to own cars, we stuck with the efficient public-transport system.  We are living on a single income for the fourth year so that our son can have a full-time mum to look after him, and imbibe our values.  While we live simply, we have created opportunities for our child to see the world, to realise that there is so much more outside this island. There are flowers to pick, open fields to run in, birds to chase; on the other hand, there are also hungry people and not all children are playing, some are working.  At the end of the day, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really want?  SHIRLEY WOON LI LIN (MDM) ---------- (End of copied text)"	m

I have become uncomfortably numb.  At least I did earlier today.  Yeah, so I got my three fillings in and it hurts like hell.  I guess that's making me kind of a bitch too, but you'd be cranky too if you just had three of your teeth drilled.  I hate novacaine.  I mean, yeah, I'm glad I don't feel any pain, but it sucks afterward.  I mean your lips feel like rubber and you can't drink anything without getting it all over your clothes.  I think dentists get shits and giggles when they've numbed up their patients and they have to rinse out their mouths.  I mean I would probably laugh my ass off if I had seen someone else in my position.  I think that's why they make you rinse to the point where it seems unnecessary.  I mean if you had that job you've got to find the few perks.  After all, dentists are the most hated people in our society (true), so it's no wonder they have the highest suicide rate of any professionals (also true). I don't know.  Lately it feels like EVERYONE around me seems to care only about themselves and they don't give a shit about what I feel or what I have to say.  I guess I'm no better than everyone else, thinking like I am, but you know how it goes.  At times it feels like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs but everyone around me is wearing earplugs. I'm alive.  I guess I should be happy.  Why can't I be happy?	f
"Who is Tinku ?  We moved recently to a new place to reduce the insane commute times to office. And we landed up at what we thought was a nice apartment complex.   As we settled down and got introduced to neighbours and all, who do I see but this 12 year old kid by the name Tinku calling me 'Uncle'. I took an immediate dislike to him, though I not sure why.  Now he barges into our home whenever he feels like it, shouting 'Uncle' in a shrill voice to tell me about some new thing that he has learnt. I think the fact that my mother gives him something or the other to eat whenever he comes is encouraging him even more.  Now coming to the interesting part - he is hardly the size of my computer table but he already knows the difference between DDR Ram and SD Ram, has his own computer, knows a couple of scripting languages - python and ruby and constantly embarasses me with questions about them.  I decide that he is too young for stuff like this and tell his mother that this is the age to play and it is likely that he will have all kinds of problems in his later years if he does not stop all this immediately.  Instead of taking it in the right spirit, she told me that I should learn more if I can't answer his questions instead of asking him to stop learning. ""And I thought you were from IIT"" was her last statement as I left in a huff!  Will this next door menace be the creator of the next Sasser Worm? Very possible, unless something is done about it :)  On an entirely unrelated note, I now have a copy of ""Python Cookbook""."	m

"YAHOOOOOO! Hay salamat! I heard the good news na wala ngang biochem sa boards. Just basic stuff. No more engot counting of how much ATPs liberated in one Kreb's cycle. No more Greek!  Am currently reading microbio. I kinda like it. Heehee. *blush* Germ freak kasi ako. Not germ freak as in i-like-germs. But germ freak as in...freaky germs!!! I always use my pinky (and only if I have to) to open public restroom doors, and medyo na-a-anxious ako kasi mauubos na yung Bath and Body Works grape antibacterial foam ko.  Anyhoo, I hope to finish up this microbio quick, para move on na ako to the next subject.     Ummm...sarap!    After borrowing a book from Dennis, we had lunch. Since Dennis was making leche flan yesterday, I told him to bring me one ""llanera"" (the oval metal thingie) today. Sarap!!! The best talaga flan ni Dennis! Medyo may coffee-ish taste yung syrup, and it's creamier in texture rather than jello-ish. Incidentally, Dennis also makes yummy adobo and saging na saba!  We had a hilarious time laughing about our nilagang-baboy adventures. I told him about my aversion to nilagang baboy, ever since that incident in the St. Peter cafeteria. The not-so mystery meat of the day was sinigang na nilagang baboy. When I used my spoon to cut through the meat-taba part, may (STOP READING IF YOU LIKE SINIGANG BABOY) (AS IN NOW!!!) (HOPE YOU HAD DINNER NA!) parang pus na lumabas!!! Ewww...aggghhhhh! Naaalala ko  may buhok pa yon.   However, in true ""Wala ka sa lolo ko!!!"" fashion, Dennis just had to top my story. One time, he was eating nilagang baboy din, when he came upon a rather chewy square piece of the meat. He fished out the piece with a fork...gulat siya kasi may baboy nipple on the center of the meat square. Bwahahaha!     ""My water bag broke!""    Classic movie line! Anyhoo, nakalimutan ko i-kwento... earlier this week, a woman gave birth in the driveway of our old College of Dent building.   It started when my prof Doc Danny saw this woman clutching her belly in pain across Faura near the Supreme Court. The woman told him she was due in July pa. He then pointed her to the direction of PGH tapos sinamahan na rin niya patawid.  Now, to get to PGH from the Supreme Court, there's a short cut where you go through the Dent driveway. When they got there, medyo whooosh! Milky and clear fluid plus blood hit the ground. Reminds of that scene in Sex and The City where Miranda broke her bag, spilling fluid on Carrie's Christian Louboutins. Nataranta si Doc Danny so he left the woman by the guard house to call for help.  Maya-maya, yung vendor sa labas nagpahiram ng monoblock chair. Patients in the Dent lobby, a lot without teeth, became instant midwives. She gave birth right then and there. Somebody lent a surprisingly clean towel. Med students arrived. While they were waiting for the stretcher, somebody cut the cord with a Swiss knife some-kind-of-sterilized with a lighter.  It's a boy!"	f

I went shopping today and got like 3 pairs of pants and 2 shirts.  Now I have something to wear!  Goody!  OOH, this catchy kinda upbeat music with a hint of techno (and a dash of paprika, hh) was on in Goodys (where I was shopping) and I was being stupid and strutting in tune with the music and doing hand motions and head bobbing, half way to embarrass my Mom.  I came to an intersection where the little tile path splits and there was some big advertisement there and I went around it, and this kid was going all out like it was a disco floor with his arms flying and feet moving.  And it wasn't like a little kid...he was a probably 10 or 11 redneck looking kid and he just stopped really abruptly when he saw that I saw him and I just started laughing to myself cuz I was just acting stupid and that kid was doing so much more.  Oh, and I heard ""Another Postcard"" by Barenaked Ladies while I was there and that's funny because it's a kinda funny song you wouldn't expect to hear there.  I finally finished To Sir With Love and I guess it was ok but it wasn't my kinda thing.  I read cliffnotes (spelling?) for Siddhartha and that seemed much more like a book I would have liked to read all the way through.     I found another artist that whoever's reading this needs to check out: Shinedown.  I've only heard the song ""45"" but it's really good and it's been stuck in my head.  That's like the first good artist I've heard of on MTV...well it  was  the rock countdown though, so I guess there are more decent artists on that.  That's about all for now...later."	m

Advertising can be divided into two broad categories—consumer advertising and trade advertising. Consumer advertising is directed at the public. Trade advertising is directed at wholesalers or distributors who resell to the public. This article focuses on consumer advertising, the form of advertising that is familiar to most people.  Consumer advertising can be further divided into national advertising and local advertising. National advertising is aimed at consumers throughout the entire country. National advertising usually attempts to create awareness among the public of a product or service, or it tries to build loyalty to a product or service. Local advertising is aimed at informing people in a particular area where they can purchase a product or service. Advertising to the public may also take the form of institutional advertising, image advertising, informational advertising, or cooperative advertising.  Institutional advertising seeks to create a favorable impression of a business or institution without trying to sell a specific product. This type of advertising is designed solely to build prestige and public respect. For nonprofit institutions, such advertising helps support the institution’s activities—for example, by encouraging blood donations or cash contributions for the work of an organization like the Red Cross. A for-profit business has other reasons for improving its reputation rather than trying to sell a particular product. In some cases a large company may sell a diversity of products. As a result, there is more value and greater efficiency in building a brand image for the company itself. If consumers learn to have a high regard for the company, then they are more likely to have a favorable opinion of all of the company’s diverse products.  Many advertisers prefer a strategy known as image advertising. These advertisers seek to give a product a personality that is unique, appealing, and appropriate so that the consumer will want to choose it over similar products that might fulfill the same need. The personality is created partly by the product's design and packaging but, more importantly, by the words and pictures the advertisements associate with the product. This personality is known as a brand image. Advertisers believe brand image often leads consumers to select one brand over another or instead of a less expensive generic product. Brand image is especially important for commodities such as detergents, jeans, hamburgers, and soft drinks, because within these product categories there are few, if any, major differences.   Informational advertising seeks to promote an idea or influence behavior. Sometimes known as public service advertising, it may try to discourage young people from using illicit drugs or tobacco, or it may encourage people to adopt safer, healthier lifestyles.  Cooperative advertising is an arrangement between manufacturers and retailers in which manufacturers offer credits to their retail customers for advertising. The credits, or advertising allowances, are based on the amount of product the retailer purchases. For example, if the retailer purchases $100,000 worth of a product from a manufacturer, the manufacturer’s cooperative advertising program may allot a 1 percent credit, or $1,000, toward the cost of purchasing an ad that will feature the product. In addition, some manufacturers will match the amount that the retailer spends, sharing the cost of the ad. In the United States antitrust laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ensure that these ad allowances are offered on equal and proportionate terms so that large retailers are not unduly favored over small retailers. Cooperative advertising is a form of local advertising because it directs consumers to local retail outlets.   urlLink	m

I got three standing ovations this weekend.   What did you accomplish?   The show's over, and now I can focus all my attention on my damn Christmas letter.  Just as soon as I get my laundry done.  Mom and Dad drove in to see the show yesterday, and on their way to my house from the theater last night they got run into the median by a bad bus driver.  They ended up blowing a tire -- and then they discovered their spare was flat as well.  Whee.  It was midnight by the time we realized our little saga wouldn't get resolved until morning, so I decided to forgo the cast party last night and get some sleep.   Then Dad and I got up at some ungodly hour this morning to meet the AAA guy who towed him to the Sears tire center -- but we were first in line and Sears even opened early, so we got all fixed up and Mom and Dad left for home by noon with four new tires safely gripping the road underneath them.  And while we were at Sears today, I got my tires rotated -- so I'm done worrying about them for another 7,000 miles.	m

"So, I read Lacy's walk down memory lane. I love how she remembers details. There's an interesting story every time she recollects something. It's not always what one might call ""accurate"", but it sure is interesting.   urlLink As she mentioned , we generally discuss how we got to where we are, but like, way back at the beginning. After ""first, there was nothing"", but before ""...and they all lived happily ever after"". This story is that story, between then and now. (Now now? Or then now? When was then now? We just missed it.) (All poorly picked out paraphrases are courtesy of Spaceballs: The Search for an Accurate Memory.)  Lacy and I are technically high school sweethearts, which is great, cause it illicits that ""awwww"" from people hearing this for the first time. I like that. I love that I can tell our child(ren) that. Back in that day, I was young, and poor. I did have lots of energy, but all too often (as she was sure to mention) it was used on things other than spending time with her. I regret that somewhat, cause that's what we fought about, and I really really hate fighting with her. She'll never believe that, but I do. So, being young, and poor, I wasn't the best boyfriend. Sorry, sweetheart.  We were supposed to get married outside three years ago, but it rained. A lot. Not as planned. Mother Nature owes me. Big. She started the repayment by giving us Xander. But she's not done. I'm watching you, Mother Nature. Even though it rained, and we were soaked, and I was really tired, and we didn't have the wedding we had planned, the very most important thing that was supposed to happen that day happened. We got married. Yeah, the details weren't perfect, but she was. I've never seen her more beautiful.  She doesn't remember the day the way I do, and that's okay. We got to here from there, through better and worse, sickness and health, cats and dogs, houses and hot tubs, doctors for ankles and doctors for babies, cable and satellite, new cars and used cars, bathroom remodeling and fence rebuilding.  Eventually, I got better, but that was awhile in coming. Not that I'm perfect now. Which sucks to admit. But I love her, and as cliche as it is to say, now more than ever. She's put up with an incredible amount of ill-advised to horrendously stupid things from me. And she doesn't even bring these things up every day! Just when I've done something else stupid. I think I'm a stupidity-debt indentured servant. But you know what, I wouldn't change it for anything. I can never undo that stuff, but I can try to be as good a husband to her as I can.  So many things have happened since we've gotten married, not to mention all the stuff before that. I can't imagine my life without her, and I don't even want to consider it.  As long as she doesn't call me her hubby, cause I hate that."	m

On my way home today I saw a teenage couple quarelling on the streets, and boy, did they get physical. I wouldn't mention which school they come from, but I'd tell you, it wasn't a very pretty sight especially with their school name printed in large font on the back of their PE shirt. The girl was giving her boyfriend some light punches and when that didn't seem to daunt him, shekicked himin his *censored*. (Ouchie!)That really got him fired up. He bent down to grab a book, rolled it up and retaliated with a good smack across the girl'sface.Though I was quite a distance away, I could feel the full impact of that blow.Even asI think of it now, I'm still rather taken aback by what I witnessed --such brutality.My heart went out to the girl, why does she still choose to hang out with him?Then again,I wouldn't know whose fault it is to start with.I would've lingered around a little longer to see how this brawl would turn out; butthe strain in my bladder muscles was getting unbearable. I hope theybreak up. But who am I to comment? Maybe that's just their way of showing affection.Inany case, the conventional way is still much safer and accepted bymost people. These fights are simply too violent. They might just kill each other without even knowing it, thinking they were justshowering care and concern.Tsk, young people nowadays.    I just learnt yesterday that JJ will be coming to our school to perform next Friday afternoon. This is the coolest thing that has ever happened to Nanyang in the past4 years of my Secondary school life, though I'm not a big fan.I hope it's not another one of those hour-long seminars on how tocompose chinesesongs, it isn't everyday that some pop star comes to your school.

"I have always loved owls. My mom says that my first words have been ""joghdeh"" (In Farsi: ""owl"").

"I'm annoyed, and if you stick around, I'll tell you why.    (yeah, I bet you didn't see that one coming a mile away!)  I have this project. Ok, it's a side-job. It's something that I'm supposed to be doing in my ""free"" time...which, as you all know, is fairly non-existent. It's this book...I have to take everything in the book (150 pgs) and type it into a spreadsheet. For the most part, that's not really a big deal...except that there's the whole no-computer-at-home problem. And the bigger, not-supposed-to-be-working-on-side-project-during-work problem. So, I figured I'd be my smart little self and work on it during my SECOND job, where they don't really care what we do as long as we answer the phone when it rings and we don't download porn. Anyway...so I saved my little spreadsheet to a disk. I've done this before when working on stuff between jobs...both my primary employer and secondary employer run the same software package, so I'm covered.   Except...when the disk doesn't work.   I got here, stuck the disk in, I was all happy about getting to work on my shit while I was here (and theoretically be getting paid for two jobs at once). I opened the A drive, I double clicked on my file....and nothing. Not one fucking thing. It didn't beep...it didn't blink...and it sure as hell didn't OPEN the file that I wanted to open. It did nothing.   Soooo...being the crafty chick that I am, I said ""Fine...be that way..I'll fix you..."" and I tried to drag the file off the disk and onto the desktop. I got some weird error message about how the file was inaccessible at this time, and to try again. What do you mean, inaccessible?! It's my god damned file...it will be accessed when I want to damn well access it!! So I tried again...same deal. I tried opening something else on the disk. Nada. Things were getting ugly. I messed with the stupid little thing for a good 35 minutes and got nothing over and over again. Finally, in an attempt to salvage what little bit of temper I had a tenuous hold on, I quit.   The disk, she no work.   Me? Up shit creek.   Happy about it? not so much.   I don't know if there's some little disk demon in this computer just chewing on my spreadsheet and not letting me open it or what, but I'm pissed about it. And since I now have nothing else to do this evening but sit here and stew, you're hearing about it.   Have a lovely evening."	f

When you 'see' something, you do so only after the light reflected from that object has passed through the interventing air and dust and other particles, the cornea, the lens, the aqueous humour, and struck the retina, where the photons have activated G-protein coupled receptors, which in turn have disasscoiated from their tri-partate state, beginnning a signal cascade which potentiates membranes which cause electrical currents to flow  along nerves to synapses where neurotransmitters of various flavours are released by one neuron and absorbed by another, again causing a change in membrane potential. This goes on for some time, until the inputs from the various retinal cells along various neurons are re-assembled by other neurons in the visual cortex of the brain and the message is transmitted to the frontal cortex of the brain, where-upon you 'see' the object.

I know it’s been awhile, but give some time and maybe you’ll understand why.  This blog has a small purpose. It is meant to communicate to you, whoever you may be, what I am thinking, whenever I get around to it.  Of course, I know a lot of you think that isn’t much of a purpose. That’s when you notice this isn’t much of a blog.  I’ve wrestled around with the thought of giving making this blog more than it is. There are times when I sit myself down in front of the computer and actually write out many things that I would like it to be.  Ask me sometime and I’ll show you.  But every time I do that, I know I won’t do it. I won’t put in the time or the effort. I won’t write every week because I have to. I won’t take a bunch of pictures to inflate some server somewhere.  Why?  Because that isn’t this blog’s purpose.  Some blogs exist to report news, others to speculate, still others to do many other things. The list goes on. Some of them are great. Some I read most everyday.  But there are times when I am looking around and I find a blog somewhere and read a few entries. They’re filled with nothings about everything… everything about nothing. These are the blogs that many people write. Hackers. Crackers. Geeks. Nerds.  These are the blogs that have no purpose. No purpose but to exist.  And, though my blog may be small, and infrequently updated, it has something that I would never want to take away. Something that brings you here. Something that makes its existence worthwhile. Something for me to rely on.  Purpose.	m

magnificence     so much happened today, and i thought about it all in the car on the way home from the concert, and i wish i could find a cohesive way to put it all into words here.  today i ate lunch with ken, who i work with. he lost a partner 3 years ago to HIV. i've known about this for a while but we have never discussed it. i got the oppurtunity to do so today. never have i been so impressed by a person's victory over odds than his in the situation. people can have a variety of responses to tremendous loss, but his was unlike any i've ever seen. the only way i can describe it is a calm acceptance that that event, like all others, was a part of the path of life. i was affected by his good nature and his peacefulness. it made me think about the things that i've been unable to let go, which are so much lesser than death.    this experience alone would have been plenty for the day, but then i got the oppurtunity to go see Sarah McLachlan perform, which I had desperately wanted to do anyway but kept telling myself I couldn't afford. since i was resigned to not going, the surprise of being called and offered a free ticket was overwhelmingly wonderful.  once i saw her,  i could not believe i considered  not  seeing her. as attached as i have always been to her lyrics, seeing her person added another dimension. she radiated a tremendous  joy  which   totally amazed me. i've never seen a performer like her. as she sang, i listened to the words i've heard hundreds of times before, and they seemed to connect with what i had been thinking earlier-pushing past your fears and grasping life, complete, knowing you can endure and still be whole at the end, moving along with the rhythm, the flow of this experience of being human.  what magnificence it was, to feel that type of energy flowing freely through your own.   sometimes i feel so lucky.	f

"What causes sinusitis?  Most cold viruses only result in a blocked nose. However, if the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages and sinuses swells up, this can block mucus drainage. Mucus builds up causing the pressure and pain of sinusitis. Bacteria or fungi are more likely to grow in sinuses that can’t drain properly, and bacterial infection often causes more inflammation and pain.   Chronic sinusitis is caused by anything that irritates the lining of the nose over long periods and causes the mucous membrane to swell. Examples include:   *grass and tree pollen, *cold air, *alcohol, *perfumes, *damp weather, *allergy to house dust mite, mould,and fungi, *chronic drug use (""snorting"").    People who have allergy-based asthma often have sinusitis as well. Indeed, any problem with the nose that blocks the drainage holes can produce sinusitis. This can include polyps (small nodules of mucous membrane), and injury that causes the bridge to lean to one side (deviated nasal septum).  Tooth and gum infections can spread to the sinuses. Rarer causes of sinusitis include conditions that weaken the immune system such as HIV and cystic fibrosis. Swimming, air pollution and smoking can aggravate sinusitis."	f

"in this journey of life, i have always had background noise. whether it be the tv, mildlessly droning on behind conversations, dinners and hours spent in front of another monitor, or music, a more active participant in everyday activities, causing me to burst into song or remember a clear event of times past. tv has always allowed concentration away from it, while music screams for attention. in both cases, since i can remember they have been a complete part of my life. in play, sleep, eat, study and creation they have constantly been with me. until recently i started going to sleep with no sounds to accompany me.    once allowed, every image that the outside noise was drowning out filled my closed eyes ceaselessly. every injury, every win - everything i have experienced in my life began crashing in front of my eyes, settling me into a cringing display of want of escape. all of this before i slept. every moment from that day and days passed flashed at horrific speeds while needing relaxation.   i started to avoid sleep until i would literary be falling over in my chair. i pushed myself into some form of exhaustion every day in hopes to side-step the silence. the pictures still flashed before my eyes, but i didn't have the energy to react or attempt to control them. so instead, i would count. yes, the pictures flashed and distracted me, but i decided if i could focus on one simple task, i could sleep. i began counting backwards from 100, every night. i would start over if the images distracted me - teaching myself to ignore these things by laborious tasks. that attempt only lasted a few days. it was horribly repetitive and extremely annoying - and not to mention unhealthy. teaching yourself to ignore yourself isn't quite a positive skill to learn.   back to where i started, avoiding sleep and despising the process, i began turning the noise off during the day. one morning i didn't turn the news on when i got up, and only realized that it was off when it was turned on. during the day, i was re-remembering those images, changing my perspective on them and realizing other definitions than the ones that made me cringe. suddenly i felt creative again. as an art student, you would think i still paint to this day, being it my love and what i went to college for, but you would be wrong. i very rarely paint as i feel my art lacks something important and i rarely have the burst of inspiration. however, once i began playing in the silence instead of trying to fight it, i felt i had something to say. i began to write more, as well. it makes no difference to me if any of it is ""good"", but the simple fact that i felt as if i had something to say is very important in my life. for everyone to realize we all have a unique perspective on life is very crucial, so for me personally it was a moment of self-realization.   once i embraced the silence, even the pain didn't sting as much.   i won't claim to say that i am completely comfortable with myself, which is all the silence is. there are pictures that make me cringe still, that still bring fresh tears to my eyes, but i can hold those moments dear, now.   i have even grown to accept silence from other people in better ways - lack of communication and response. i still go through the doubt and the fear, but the quiet isn't as scary as it used to be. i have also learned the appreciation of silence in other people. mindless ramblings aggrevate me, conversational competitions annoy me. they always have, but as a person who loves debate, i have always been a more aggressive conversationalist - touting people for pseudo-intelligence barely covering a thick gooey mass of insipidness. as egotistical a that sounds, everyone knows that person who has run just a bit faster, had life harder or makes more money than you - and enjoys telling you about all their better information, all of the time. now, i have swtiched to someone who speaks when i have something to say, not when i need to fill the void. that doesn't mean i am particulary quiet. if it's a subject that i know about, i am a very happily active participant. if something interests me, i am engrossed. i just don't waste my time on conversations on how crazier someone else's day was when clearly 75% of it is a lie.   until these recent days, i hadn't understood how much knowledge is gained from silence. i understood you could learn a vast amount about other people by merely listening to their words and watching thier body language, but i never thought i would come to the understandings i have about myself. i never thought the process could be as easy, either. if i had only realized at the beginning to just let go.   now, when i go to sleep, those images flash before my eyes which turn into stories, which turn into dreams i forget and then, i am awake. it's now a seamless process which requires no effort and is comfortable and soft.   i am coming to peace with who i am and i have come to peace with the silence."	f
The trip to Vancouver was nice. The children were able to see all of their cousins and enjoyed playing with some of them nearly every one of the twelve days we were there. We also took them on the SkyTrain and the SeaBus and took them on a quick tour of Granville Street downtown and Pacific Centre this past Monday. They really enjoyed it. They installed a second SkyTrain line since we lived there and we went on it to get back home Monday. It’s hard to believe Brentwood Mall and Lougheed all have SkyTrain Stations now. Surrey Place Mall has been radically changed—it doesn’t even look the same anymore. There’s a new office tower and the exterior and interior have been completely remodelled. It looks cool, especially when the reflection of the SkyTrain shows in the glass exterior.  The day we arrived was a bit uncomfortable. There were twelve people in the van during our 45 minute ride from the airport to Surrey. It was hot in there and the humidity made it difficult to breathe easily. My parents had their thermostat at 28° that first night, so that didn’t help any either. That whole night I felt I was suffocating. I got used to it over the next day and was fine until I came home. The dry weather in Alberta the day we got back gave me a bloody nose. My nose doesn’t like the dry weather.  Anyhow, that wasn’t the hassle referred to in my title. The hassle was the stress of our trip back home. We were supposed to board our WestJet flight at 11:15 PST and arrive at 13:45 MST. At about twenty after eleven, they announced that as a result of the snowstorm (read 2-5 cm of snow) the night before and that was continuing yesterday depleted their de-icer supplies and our flight had been cancelled.  We were then instructed to travel back to the other end of the airport and pick up our ten pieces of luggage. We did this and put them on three baggage carts. Luckily, each cart had a basket where our children could sit, so we didn’t have to drag them behind us.  Then the two of us had to take the three carts down a switchback ramp to the arrivals level. That was a real hassle, but luckily a kind woman offered to push one of the carts. Once we arrived at the lower level, our luggage was loaded onto a charter bus. We were then bussed 1.5 hours to the Abbotsford airport where an alternate flight was suppose to leave at 14:00. The bus pulled in at 13:55. Luckily for us, the plane was waiting for a second bus, so we had time to grab something to eat.  We then had to load our ten pieces of  luggage from the bus back on to three baggage carts. The Abbotsford carts, unfortunately, did not have baskets in which our children could sit, so the two of us were pushing/pulling three carts and dragging two children. We had to check in all our baggage again and we finally boarded the plane at close to 15:00.  We arrived in Calgary around 17:30 MST, and after we filled our truck up with gas, we were back on the highway home around 18:15.  Originally, we planned to grab some groceries when we arrived in Lethbridge since we had eaten all our perishable food before we left. But since we arrived in Lethbridge at 20:30 and it was New Year’s Eve, none of the supermarkets were open. We ended up spending 35$ on two bags of groceries at Green’s Pop Shop.  I was just glad to get home.                 urlLink Read more...	f
so my boss asked me what i want to do on the production today.  im not sure.  there are so many jobs that i cant think of one that i could do because i have no experience.    but then he posed this problem.  someone, experienced, needs to stay here and run the office.  if this person stays then they don't go to prauge.  but the trade off is that that person will be paid through out the production. those that go to prauge cant be garenteed that.    so its better for me to stay here because we have two things in development that i am part of and i would be paid more and longer, but then i forfit the experience of working on set and being over seas.  but my boss said i could come for a visit or something.  so i must decide.  the more logical is to stay here and make more money and work on the other projects.  but i need to get out of this office, damn!  but theni would be the boss here ;)  but then i lose prauge... hrmmmmm.. any advice?!	m
"Look Homeward, Angel   Although WB mainstay  Angel  celebrated 100 episodes  just last week ,  urlLink the show has been cancelled . Things move faster in tv than a demon out of Hellmouth. According to  Medialifemagazine.com :  ""There has been talk of special movie events next year, but nothing has been confirmed.  Angels  ratings are up more than 20 percent this year among adults 18-49, one of just two WB dramas to rise, but they are still relatively low. The WB evidently didnt see many long-term prospects for the show, which was barely renewed last season.""  Too bad. It was a surprise. Even the  urlLink Watch with Kristin  online gossip column wasn't aware. In a Friday column, she interviewed the show's vamp  David Boreanaz :   Kristin : One hundred episodes. Must feel good.    Boreanaz : Yes. I never imagined the show getting to 100 episodes. I only imagined getting the work done that was in front of me. When we started this journey four and a half seasons ago,  David Greenwalt  and  Joss Whedon  were like, 'One down, 99 to go,' and I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa--I need to focus on this scene we're shooting on the rooftop.' And here we are. ""   And there he went . Oh, the shadenfreude is thick. And so, on that elegiacal note, we leave you with a smattering of  urlLink Thomas Wolfe  -- the wolfman, if you will, that long forgotten American author of upper-middlebrow sapiness:  ""As they walked townward, he tried to talk, explaining himself in babbling incoherent spurts.  'It was like this,' he began, 'if I had known, but at that time I didntof course I know it was my own fault for   'Oh, for Gods sake!' said Ben impatiently.  'Dry up!  I dont want to hear about it.  Im not your damned Guardian Angel.'   ""The news was comforting.  So many people, after our fall from grace, are.""   Indeed."	m
"Satellite shot  This was taken on Feb 8th and shows the  urlLink snow-covered mtns.  of the Appalachians.   The WB...   ...has cancelled Angel!!!  NO!  You bunch of whankers.....   A statement from The WB:  For the last seven years Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer have been cornerstones of our network. The sum total of the work done on those shows has produced some of the proudest moments in our history. Like some of the great series that are leaving the air this year, including Frasier and Friends, the cast, crew, writers and producers of Angel deserve to be able to wrap up the series in a way befitting a classic television series and that is why we went to Joss to let him know that this would be the last year of the series on The WB. We have discussed continuing the Angel legacy with special movie events next year, which is still on the table. In a perfect world, all of these details would be completed before this information went to the press so that we could be definitive about the show's ongoing future. But in any case, we did not want to contemplate this being the last year of Angel without giving the show the option of crafting their own destiny for this character and for this series. David Boreanaz continues to be one of the finest, classiest and friendliest actors we have had the pleasure to work with and we hope that the relationship furthers from here. The same can be said for all the actors and producers on the show.     Stealing this website from a guy who does ""web pick of the day"" selections...

it's sort of been a lazy weekend, but isn't that what these days are for?  yesterday, i cleaned up around the apartment after i got up at 11:30 a.m. (greg got up at 5:30 a.m. to study for his 8 a.m. final. yes, law students have finals on saturday.) then my mom came down and took me out to eat. we watched the second half of the UK-michigan state game with greg. then greg and i hung out with katie and brad. we all went to the kentucky horse park to see the christmas lights. it was festive. the moving horse lights were the coolest.   greg is studying most of today for his last final tomorrow. i just finished working on my dad's resume and cover letter for a job he's applying for. aren't i a nice daughter? although, writing a cover letter for someone else is easier than writing my own. i think i'm going to finish christmas shopping and get some of relatives gifts ready for the mail, at least the ones who aren't coming to town.   it's unfortunate i really don't like any the remaining survivor players. rooting for someone makes the finale better. (the finale is thursday, in case you didn't know. that's the reunion and all.) i guess i'll cheer for brian, and definitely cheer against helen and jan. clay is so-so.	f
Letting Go   You wouldn’t think with the life I’ve had that I would have a problem letting go of people.  My life up until the last 8 years had been a series of moves: new places, faces, and experiences to keep me occupied.  I find however, that when it comes to those in my life, I have a distinct problem with letting them go quietly into that good night.  I believe it’s because I’ve come to crave permanency, some sense of stability to give roots to an otherwise unstable and unpredictable life.  I remember at 18 years of age, crying about college when others should have been happy, simply because I was too damn tired to pack up yet again, and leave behind those I had come to love and rely upon.    I have somehow found myself in an odd sort of limbo: fearful of losing those that I care about to a tomorrow that’s never promised and therefore fearful of growing close, and at the same time clinging to those that I’ve come to depend upon, no matter how much it may be time to move on.  Recent events have brought this problem to new light.  The first is my current employment.  When my boss hired me, he neglected to inform me that he was running for re-election this year.  To his credit, he ran unopposed four years ago and expected to coast by this year in the same fashion.  Let me explain: like the President, a District Attorney (DA) has to run every four years for his job.  Now, not many people have bosses that are re-elected every four years, but I guess I’m just one of the lucky ones.  And like the President, a new District Attorney is not at all obligated to keep any of the old staff.  Normally, your job is based on your performance.  My job however, is based on the whims of the newly elected.  And the election is less than two weeks away.  To add to the drama, the Judge that I have practiced solely in front of is being challenged as well.  The other two judges?  Their jobs are secure (running unopposed).  But the person challenging my Judge has a score to settle: he trounced her in the last election and she wants a rematch.  To truly honor these events we have a new urban legend currently circulating around our office (for the first one see “Things to Do in Albany . . . “): there was a DA’s office somewhere in south Georgia that had the same DA for almost 12 years.  But when the DA was defeated, the new DA held a staff meeting and fired all of the Assistant DA’s.  Variations abound, including one where the new DA calls in all the Assistants one at a time and tells them if they need to find new jobs or not.  Never being one to waver, I have fully thrown my support behind my boss, which means that if he loses, I could very well find myself out on my ass in January.  Luckily, I will have almost 6 months to look for a new job should he lose.  I have also thrown my support behind my Judge, which means if he loses, the new Judge will do her best to make my life a living hell.  I must admit the prospect of having to leave Albany scares me.  It’s not that I love it here: I bitch and complain about the lack of activities, and my friends miss me in Atlanta.  Maybe Greg, the Chief ADA (who’s  definitely  fired if the challenger wins – he’s the metaphorical Vice President), put it best when he said “everyone wants to leave on their own terms.”  I know that I’m eventually going to go, but I want to leave when I’m ready, not because some heinous power monger forced me out.  For the first time in almost a year, I’m scared: not scared that I’m going to be trapped down here, but scared that I won’t be trapped down here.  I realize that despite the fits and starts, I have a house I like, friends I care about, and a job I love.  I have a life here, and it hurts to think it could be taken away so soon.  Somehow things have grown familiar on me when I wasn’t looking.  They say familiarity breeds contempt, but in me its grown a sense of contentment, of completion.  And I don’t want to lose the faces in my office to new faces, or pack up yet again for greener pastures.    The second is the departure of my ex-boyfriend.  At first I was mightily relieved that he was removing himself from the vicinity.  Especially in light of rumors that had all but eviscerated my social life (see “The List”).  I was already looking forward to being able to visit my old haunts without feeling haunted by his presence.  I even endeavored to avoid bidding adieu, feeling that the event was wholly unnecessary considering everything that had preceded it.  However, a returned object and a note on my blog changed my mind.  I believed that the least I could do is say farewell to an individual that made the first months of my life here bearable and the last months a strive for independence and an exercise in strength.  I visited, with pretext in hand, ready to say my goodbyes and wish him well on his new life.  But as I spoke with him it dawned on me that his perfect life: the job, the new love, the escape from a town he had long outgrown, had very real, human flaws.  I believed him invincible, cocky, and formidable when I first met him.  The man I now spoke to was defeated, humble, and unsure of himself.  He was Samson, blinded and shorn.  And somehow, in that moment as I looked at him, he was all the more beautiful and real to me. It wasn’t until later that evening that I began to cry.  I would like to blame my maudlin mood on the martinis I had consumed earlier with friends, but I know that the bittersweet ache I felt wasn’t alcohol induced.  Although we hadn’t spoken in months, I realized that I would sorely miss this individual that had largely contributed to the last eight months of my life.  Like that last day of high school, I realized that the things that you had grown to dread, the moments that hurt you, are sometimes the things that you miss the most.  Maybe it’s because those things give us strength and define us just as much as the triumphs.  Or maybe people are just suckers for pain.  So now, in a moment of clarity, I will say this: I did love him once.  And when he left, I realized that there was nothing I could do to stop the people I had loved from leaving.  Breaking off from him, for whatever reason, didn’t kill the pain, it just masked it for a little while until I saw him again.  And that’s not such a bad thing.  I’ve learned that letting go of a person doesn’t mean you stop caring about them.  I guess that will come later.	f

"KERRY A DESERTER?   Thanks to  urlLink Ted  for this.  Here's something I didn't know.  According to  urlLink Vets Against Kerry , John Kerry didn't finish his tour of duty in Vietnam.  After recieveing the Silver Star, Kerry used an obscure Navy regulation to leave Vietnam and his crew before completing his tour of duty.  Does that sound like a hero to you?  All veterans are heroes, but turning your back on your ""band of brothers"" and running before your tour of duty is up is sorry.

"I almost had a date tonight.  Actually, fuck ""almost""; I  had  a date, for about half an hour.  It was going to be perfect.  Here I'd spent all last semester waiting for the right time, perfect place, best opening line, trying to calm my fears of rejection and step out of my comfort zone for once...Once!!  And today, I finally took that chance.  There have been signs all along.  She tried to hide her affection beneath a surly, tough exterior, but I saw beyond that.  We joked about the old hometown, laughed at how much we secretly wanted each other.  But underneath, I knew we were laughing about something real.    We planned to meet for beers, and those only lead to bad places; I was counting on it.  I figured such an invitation would be obvious in its entreaty.  After all, we ""joked"" that our movie and dinner the day after our last final was a date.  Clearly she was sending me signals that she was ready and waiting for me to initiate the next step.  Any remaining shards of doubt vanished when we had our lunch together this afternoon.  It was glorious.  We bonded; we shared things few others knew.  I looked at her; she looked at me.  She finished my olives, for god's sake!  If that's not a come-on, I don't know what is!  So when she called half an hour after our arrangements were made, I was excited.  I thought perhaps she couldn't wait to see me and wanted to move our plans up a bit; or maybe she had to tell me something too difficult to discuss in person.  I tried to sound nonchalant, telling her I was just ""reading the newspaper"" when I was actually admiring her picture in the law school's directory, as I have a tendency to do quite often, when all my life seems to shrink and the darkness curls up around me.    ""Listen, uhh.."" she said.  It sounded serious.  My heart was pounding; this was it!!  ""...I have bow out of tonight.""  Crushing.  Tumbling down a rocky mountain-side onto a torn, jagged terrain not entirely unlike the broken floor of Mordor.    ""Oh?"" I recovered quickly.    ""Yea, I forgot about this thing I'm doing with Mark tonight.""  Oh yes, this ""Mark"" person.  She refers to him on occasion, calling him her ""live-in.""  It's not entirely certain he even exists.  But I remained calm.    ""Okay.""  Did that sound too pained?  ""We'll definitely do it another time, though,"" she offered.  Was that hope I heard in her voice?    ""Alrighty.""  Like when you finally find the courage to admit the truth?!  Such was my date that wasn't.  I'll go on, somehow.  Probably get some coffee next door to the bar that was to be the site of our meeting.  But I won't go in, oh no.  Maybe come home and console myself with Queer As Folk's Season Two on DVD.    But I don't plan on letting myself get this hurt again, not for a very long time."	f

The more traditional residents have started to complain, creating a storm of controversy over the historic nature of Cabbagetown. In this case, however, tradition seems to be taking a back seat to wealth and power. Indeed it has, from the sight of the newly cleaned sidewalks and the freshly paved roads as well as the beautiful colouring of the fresh flowers and newly added trees.  Contents: Silvius  Compton shambles up the street, bundeled in his heavy parka and winter boots. He looks spooked, beady eyes flashing about.  Erick arrives from the north. Erick has arrived. Isobel arrives from the south. Isobel has arrived.  Isobel steps from a taxi and begins to run down the street, not an easy thing in heels.... her eyes wide with concern as she sees the damage....  A jittery looking Compton is skirting around what parked cars there are along the street, and peering over top of his erstwhile cover.  Isaac arrives from the south. Isaac has arrived.  Isaac runs up shortly after Isobel as he gets lost in the city easily. He clamors to a stop and a huff as he sees Isobel.  Isobel hurries to take a look around and then moves towards the crowd that has gathered  Erick moves down the street, not running, not panicked. Like a king he seems to move, but then here he pretty much is. However anger is on his face as he surveys the area and prepares for the fall out. Car alarms and shocked screams and yells fill the air, but overshadowing all this commotion is the roar of flames, green flames actually, which currently completely engulf the old McDulan family grocery. The glass of nearby buildings and car windows litter the streets.  Silvius slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode!  Isobel looks over as she spots Isaac and just nods. calling to him ""I caught a cab"" then she begins to move through the crowd.. wanting to hear what the coppers had to say  Compton stands across the street. His face flush with excitement. Doing a fine job representing the do-nothing-voyeur-public in times of crisis.  Erick moves down the street, scanning for only a moment. He taps a few people as he moves by them, the most Irish from the look of it. Directing people to take the wounded to the other side of the street. That thin line of anger still there. The cops are going to show up for this one. He knows it and it pleases him not at all. A few others directed to find the owners of those cars and get the alarms shut off before he moves to where he directed the injured to be taken, god knows when the paramedics will arrive and he is assuming people need help now.  Isaac scans around and makes his way over to Isobel and asks, ""All right, since you got here before me, what do you think happened?""  Isobel shakes her head and points towards the back of one of the estates where her little apartment is... ""my god I was there only 30 minuets ago... "" she shivers and then adds quickly ""I need to help.. "" with that she goes over to one of the ladies and helps her up from the ground, the poor dear is pretty banged up but she can walk.. carefully she leads the lady to a safe looking stoop, assuring her she needs to have some one look at those cuts...  The interesting thing is, no cops or firemen seem to be anywhere around here. But what's more is the strange green color that seems to permeate the flames. As erick directs the irish folk, they nod, some growing calmer as the seems to recognize the man a bit. They move off to help those they can.  Compton fishes one of those cheap disposeable cameras form his parka's pocket along with a small flask. FIrst he takes a belt of the hooch, to keep the home fires burning and then starts taking random snap shots of the chaos and carnage around him. zzip *CLICK* zzzip *CLICK*  Spotting Isobel Erick moves to the lady she has helped. ""Take her two doors up lass. We need all of them together. See if ya can find anyone else with first aid trainin as well."" He then moves back there.  Admiistering the little first aid he can. Actually tossing one man the keys to his house and telling him where the first aid kit is. He finally seems to notice the green flame and mutters something about old copper wiring.  Isobel nods her head and hurries to obey. guiding the lady to a safe place and shouting in relief as she spots one of the locals who works at the hospitial, he is hurrying towards Erick  Isaac shoves through the crowd himself and looks upon the scene. Since there are no police around, he takes a quick scan for damages... and then begins talking to people that seem to have had property damaged, especially cars....  Jim arrives from the south. Jim has arrived.  Jim walks through the intersection of Parliament and College, to see several people he recognizes. He tosses a raised eyebrow to Isobel as he passes.  Isobel works to get small children reunited with their parents. She is moving through out the milling mass, her heels a real pain in the butt  Jim walks north along Parliament to Wellesley. Jim has left.  Everyone on the streets has relatively minor injuries, glass, cuts, that sort of thing. the blast seems to have been engineered to engulf the building with little collateral damage.  Erick does not even look at the man. The first aid kit is his major concern. He probably knows him from years ago when his sister ran the place, if he's that old. He works on the wounds until the kit arrives and he can do it properly. One of the men leading people over is directed. ""Go ta tha pub and get Seamus to get a cop here. An Irish one if possible, if there are still any onna force. But this shite we canna handle on our own. Not until later."" The look in his face says someone is going to bleed for this, but that is later, this is now.  Jim arrives from the north. Jim has arrived.  Isaac looks at Erick as he is done making his rounds. ""What the hell are you talking about? You're making this sound like terrorist attack.""  Isobel looks up and actually spots Jim, she waves to him ""Jim Jim! Help me please, I can na find this little ones Mother.."" she winces as she holds the crying child.. trying to keep up with the dirty faced red haired tyke.....  Jim yells articulately. ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""  Swan arrives from the west. Swan has arrived.  Jim goes about trying to pull the worst injured out of the rubble.  Erick looks up at the disheveled man who adresses him and just smiles grimly. ""You a reporter or a cop lad? If ya are piss off I got me hands full here if ya didna notice. If ya aren't then it ain't terorists I'm worried aboot."" He ducks at the second explosion, almost seeming to before it happens. ""God damn it!"" That dark look again on his face.  Isaac notes the pre-emptive reaction and says, ""You know something about this, tell me what the hell is going on now, or I'll just have the cops take you in for questioning also.""  Isobel is trying to help up one of the older men who usually sits outside and plays checkers.. she still has the crying dirty faced child on her hip,.. bouncing him gently as she steadies Old Mat... ""its ok darln' we will find your mudder not to fret.... "" as she speaks Old Mat looks up and blinks ""why lass my mudder has been dead these last 22 years ... you sure you are not the one who took a brick to the head  Siomen arrives from the west. Siomen has arrived.  The building explodes again, seems possibly a gas main or the like finally gave to the intense heat. sirens are heard in the distance, growing closer as the entire neighborhood, the irish portion at least, seems to come to life to help. Neighbors futilely attempt to cool the fire with garden hoses and fire extinguishers, others form a bucket brigade. Yet more seem to come from the clinic, taking in the wounded there.  Isobel blinks in confussion and then has to laugh, but it is short lived as the second explossion hits... ""i.. I was talking to the child Mat..."" she sighs and then shakes her head. ""nar mind.. is going to be ok. come on hurry .. hurry we do nah need to take more damamge  Compton keeps working his tourist trinket camera, snapping shots of the human conflict that is unravelling itself out on the street. He stands safely behind the scene next to some battered parked cars.  Swan moves to the periphery of the gathered group, speaking into a cellphone, as he scans the area for imminent signs of danger.  Jim grabs what people he can, and begins to pull them towards the clinic, he hollers at the top of his lungs. ""Is there a fuckin' doctor out here? Come on you fuckers!"" He glances over to Compton and yells at the man. ""You! Yeah you, motherfucker! Drop the goddamn camera and give these people a hand you sadistic fuck!""  Hept-Seshet arrives from the west. Hept-Seshet has arrived.  Erick stands as the people atre taken to the clinic. They're better off there. He looks at Isaac. What I know is that two explosions just hit me fuckin' neighborhood and you're gettin in me face. Now get the hell outta me face, and if'n yer smart out of me neighborhood before I stick something hard and big and possibly flamable up yer arse. This is not the time to be accusin me of shite.  Siomen wanders down the street, drawn by the sirens and explosions, just another gawking fool Swan finishes his conversation and pockets his phone.  Escalus has arrived.  Isaac looks at the truck pulling up and waves the person emerging over to him. He then turns back to erick and says, ""Are you threatening me now? So now they have to question you /and/ hold you on account of verbal assualt?""  Isobel blinks as she hears Erick being yelled at by Isaac but she does not interfere, instead she sets the small child down and begins to move her way back towards the cars where the man with the camera is snapping away like some voyeur tourist...  Swan walks west along College to Jarvis. Swan has left.  Erick smiles at the man. ""I ain't threatenin ya welp. I'm givin ya friendly advice. Ya ain't a cop or ya'd be helpin out. Yer steppin on toes here, so either get ta helpin, or get tha fook out. Ain't noone here want ta deal with yer attitude, you're causin people ta suffer. An before ya threaten me ya might want ta keep in mind that ya accused me of some pretty nasty shit happenin ta a business I have interest in."" He's losing his temper and his patience. But the man in front of him doesn't hold it for long, his head swivels and he begins to move in the same direction as Isobel, growling under his breath about vultures as the rude man is forgotten in favor of a much more satisfying target.  Giving the hecklers no mind, Compton continues to document the crisis. Sure it's thankless work. Nobody cares for the paparazzi during the mess, but afterwards when Mom's read the Time magazine in line at the supermarket, and comment how tragic the images are or when the CEO's on the shitter reading that months National Geographic he realizes how brave his country men are to have done what they did in times of need, all because of the pictures. North America the contradiction. No one wants to love the ones who get the picture, they just want to see the images. The photographer and the photograph have become alienated from each other. The images must be pure. They must come from no where in to the media. Compton is just one of the thankless scum who feed Canada its hypocritical sense of moralness.   Jim drags those he can out of the rubble, and begins administering what rudimentary first aid he can amidst the chaos. He tears up clothing to make tourniquets, elevates injured limbs, and talks softly to those on the brink. On occasion he pulls a silver flask from his jacket, and allows an injured soul a slug from its contents. All the while, he is alternately screaming at others to help out, get supplies, and occasionally, to 'fuck right off'. His presence is not one of leadership, but some stunned bystanders seem to acknowledge his cries, and join him in aiding the injured.  Hept-Seshet looks around and she grabs a few people and she points them at some people, ""You, put pressure on that wound like this."" and she shows the person how and then she points the other person at another wounded person, ""You, hold pressure on her headwound."" she then stalks over to Erick, her little form likely like a puff of edierfdown but the fury in her golden eyes packs a whallop, ""Ypou don't worry about the stupid scut snapping pictures! Help with the wounded, let him be a jackass, the hurt people need help more!"" she souts before turning to help more, organizng more bystanders. Isobel has partially disconnected.  Ryan arrives in a blue-green chevy, pulling as close as he can to the scene without interfering with police or individuals trying to get out of the area. When he gets as close as he can with his car, Ryan then parks and gets out to wander into the area on foot. He retrieves a small disposable camera from the vehicle before making his way in Isaac's direction. ""Tragedy makes everyone edgy,"" Ryan says as if to catch Isaac's attention, ""Best to leave him be. As Ted's elsewhere, it'd be helpful if you got a few pictures as we do what we can to help."" Ryan then offers Isaac the camera before gazing about the scene to decide how best help can be given.  Siomen stands and watches, he shifts his backpack slightly and blinks at the scene, he seems rather quiet and just takes it all in. He doesn't seem to recognize anyone, nor want to be bothered by anyone either.  Isaac grunts and takes the camera. ""Your the damn reporter, you should be doing this."" Still, he makes sure to get a snapshots of the strange flames coming from the store, the helpers, and any apparent damage caused while standing back.  The sirens finally arrive, not too bad of a response time. Though judging from the fierce flames,the damage is done, the fire fighters will have a time of containing the blaze, let alone saving any of the building. And if anyone was inside... it'd be a good bet they aren't alive any longer. But none the less, the fire trucks pull through the crowd and Toronto's Bravest scatter to their work. 3 ambulances pull into the scene as well, and the paramedics start to take over the first aid.  Skip arrives from the north. Skip has arrived.  John arrives from the west. John has arrived.  Silvius pages: okay, Isobel is kicking at you and making a grab for the camera, do me a favor and roll me a   Compton rolls dexterity+dodge privately to Silvius at diff 6. For a total of 2 success(es).  Silvius pages Compton and Isobel: Okay, Isobel's action was successful, so if is could pose it, and Compton, when your pose comes up, pose your reaction, yet failure to resist please ;)  Isobel slips through the cars towards Compton, gritting her teeth as she suddenly goes into action. With a whirl of her feet she suddenly slams Compton with a flying drop kick... the camera sails into the air....... and falls smashing to the ground as she strikes with incredible agility... and jumps back...  Erick blinks as he is dissrespected in hsi neighborhood again. ""Lass. If ya interfere with tha professionals doing tha medical work again I will see yer bitch ass taken in fer it. Don'tcha give me another god damn order, and what I said about getting the fook out goes just as well fer you."" He looks back at issac, too many people with Cameras. So long as he don't take yer picture doin tha let him keep his guy gettin the pictures is actually helping. Then damn the tux he's moving to the front of one of the bucket brigades, until the hoses can get to work.  the hoses finally get hooked up and the water starts flying. The few fire personnel that are not on hose teams start to usher the civilians back, breaking up the bucket brigades with words of appreciation. Off i the distance more sirens can be heard approaching. The rescue personnel finally get the wounded under control, thanking those who have been helping but asking them to back off and allow them to do their jobs.  Compton, who is just doing his part to record the incredible vitality of the human spirit for prosperity spots the crazy woman heading at him at the last moment. He tries to move out of the way, but being older and heavier doesn't have much of a chance against an unprovoked attack like this. Isoble does her thing. $12.99 camera skitters away, and the big guy stands there just looking mighty insulted. ""Crazy cunt."" is all Compton deadpans.  Jim stands aside, allowing the crews to do their jobs. He looks around for a place that needs a hand. His jacket, hat and gloves are gone now, given to some more deserving soul. He stands caked in dust and slushy mud, coughing and shivering, his empty flask in hand and a glazed look in his eyes as he surveys the mayhem.  A bloodied and bruised redheaded boy pushes his way past the medics that try to tend to him. he looks beaten, not from the explosion, but more like he had just recently had his ass kicked good. He stumbles over to Erick and slumps against him, whispering to the man.  Hept-Seshet shakes her head a bit as she watches the mess going on and she sighs as she looks around.  Ryan simply nods to Isaac as he says, ""Yeah, good afternoon to you as well."" As Compton is 'attacked', Ryan frowns and mutters to Isaac, ""Uh...keep taking pictures. I'll smooth things over..."" He then steps aside to allow any firefighters and paramedics who might have arrived to pass without causing an obstruction. After all, there are plenty of stories of those who meant to help accidently causing more injury through their own incompetence. Instead, Ryan seems to quote as if his words were important, ""After all, such photographs hold a great importance. Despite those who see the world through only the glassy world of television or the dry site of paper, there is still a need for them to be involved in such tragedies. How can one mourn the fallen if there is nothing to which their memory is held? How can one truly understand that which the police and firefighters must put up from day to day? How can one truly appreciate the safety which they take for granted? No, continue with your important role and you will be overlooked, but appreciated nonetheless.""  Siomen watches in amazement at the scene. all this noise, burning, smoke... and now some fighting. He just shakes his head slightly in wonder.  Nothing helps people feel more calm and secure than to see a lawyer running towards the scene of an accident. Maybe not, but Skip Tanner thinks so. Attracted to the sounds of sirens and such like a deer to headlights, he slows his pace as he nears the scene. ""All right, Skip, this is it. Gotta look good here"" He takes a moment to check his hair, adjust his suit and make sure that there arent any sweat stains from the run. ""Good, looking sharp. Important to look professional."" Clearing his throat, he takes on a very serious expression and speaks to an imaginary person to practice his lines, ""Im very sorry for your loss, maam and/or sir, but it is important at times like these to protect your interests and the interests of your family. You dont want to miss out on any reparation to damages"" As he gets on to the more legal terms, he starts mumbling incoherently as if hes practiced the lines many times before until he finally just nods, ""All right, sounds good. Lets get this show on the road."" Adjusting his tie, he walks calmly towards the scene. This just might be a great opportunity for a little name and card dropping. Nearing the chaos, his carefully practiced lines start falling apart since Skip has never actually used them in a real life situation. Standing awkwardly in the middle of everything, he just dumbly asks, ""Uh.does anybody need a lawyer?""  John blinks at the giant clusterfuck as he approaches down the street. He slips into an alley and moves through it as best he can toward the fire without being seen. The man blinks his eyes and they change colour briefly before taking on their normal blue. They are still somehow... different. He moves toward the crowd now quietly, keeping an eye out for something.  Isaac looks at John as he approaches and waves. He then tosses the camera to Ryan and says, ""Right. Here, you sway off the vengeful drunkish soccer watchers while I do something else."" He pads over to Skip and points to where the store owner or however looks like they might have been hurt is currently and says, ""There you go, a real crisis. There's some people that might need your help.""  Erick holds the boy to him, managing to get the blood smeared on his tux, seems to have forgotten he was wearing the damn thing. He picks the lad up, as he does he reaches into his pocket tossing a bill at Compton. ""That should pay for camera."" then he carries the boy to the nearest paramedic. Speaking to him softly. When he is done he makes sure the boy is in the poper hands and watches him, that look of rage on his face darker now.  Crisis always brings the nut jobs out it seems. Not out of the proverbial woodwork but out of what would normally be sane, moral people. Compton realizes he's been too close too long with such people. People who dream of greatness through out their mundane days, only to have something extreme happen and take licence to act out. He uses a good dose of rationality, zips up his parka, stuffs his hands in to his pockets and turns to go, only breifly pausing to pick up the battered camera.  ~FIN~"	m

Families aren't biological.  I've learned - that no matter how good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.

I too fondly remember a time when I could fit both legs into a single pantleg of my size 30 waist JNCOs in the 4th grade.  I also remember the furious discussions with my father after covering them in grass stains playing football at recess.  It is an era I will forever remember with a twinge of longing in my heart.  I believe the same will be true once I exit high school.  In the elementary years all my friends and I could think about was reaching middle school, and now I wish I had savored those moments.  Understanding this time conundrum, I refuse to make the same mistakes twice.  Not even in the most boring, drawn out day of high school will I ever say “Man, I wish I was in college,” because I know I’ll blink my eyes and be a forty year old man sitting in a recliner in my underwear with a beer on the table and a hand in my drawls as an homage to Al Bundy.  For a seventeen-year-old that is a terrifying thought and one I’m not ready to accept, but that day is point B, and fortunately I’m still at point A.  But unlike my 11-year-old self, this time I’m going to enjoy the journey.  Today I still wear size 30 waist pants, only they fit a little differently.   -Ryan  PS – Pat and Ryan – stunning resemblance, but I think it’s Alf, (Alien Life Form)	m

At first, I was wondering why would a woman want a wife. Then, when I read this essay I thought this was the way I felt. I had to read it to my husband you would think he would say something, NO!! He didn't, you would think that would of made him say hey I'm sorry that you would need a wife. I will start helping out, but No!!   A lotof women can sympathize with Judy some women have husbands that seem to take us for granted and don't understand what we really go though. We work harder then we do in the workforce, we sometimes work or even go to school and they still expect us to do everything. I think we should have this put into a poster to have hanging where our men can see it so they can be reminded how much we do for them.	f
"How do I spell relief?  O-N-E M-O-R-E D-A-Y.  I can hear the angels singing the hallelujah chorus as I type.  There were a lot of kids today that I couldn't wait to see walk out my classroom door for a final time.  Like the kid who flipped me the bird earlier this year.  Oh, and the kid that acts like a monkey all the time.  And, the kid who talks non-stop.  Oh, wait.  That's all of them.  But, I am trying to stay upbeat and positive through my last days.  Hey!  I saw that eye roll.  I really am.  Some of the kids have been really sweet, and I have received some very nice letters, pictures, and gifts.  I even got a gift card to Target from the kid that proclaimed in front of my class that he thought about committing suicide because people were so mean to him.  Yeah.  I said proclaimed.  He literally got up on the stage in my room and announced it.  You know that Pearl Jam song ""Jeremy?""  That's what went through my head when he did it.  I have never been that scared in my own classroom.  Right.  Back to the positive.  Ummmm...  I've only had two kids fail my final so far.  Yes, they failed the theatre arts final.  It was an open-note final.  They failed it.  And, they didn't just fail it, they bombed it.  One got a 24% and the other got a 38%.  See, that's positive.

"Local business   The Music Hall has been closed since the 3rd week of February.  I just did a search to see if anyone else has noticed and  urlLink one other person has :  Danforth Music Hall Now Closed?  posted by jlangdon on March 11, 2004 at 10:15am TORONTO, CANADA - Yet another historic cinema in Toronto is closed. The Danforth Music Hall, which started life as Allen's Danforth Theatre in 1920, has been closed since the third week of February.   Since 1998 the Music Hall has been a member of the Festival Cinemas chain, showing second run films mostly with the occasional concert or play thrown into the schedule. It is the last operational theatre built in the Allen's chain. All its sister theatres have been either demolished or converted into other uses.   No details are being provided as to the reason for the closing. The message on the Festival Cinemas' Hotline (416-690-2600) states simply that the theater is closed.   Given the recent collapse of the Uptown and ceiling falling at the Bloor cinema, Toronto cinema fans have reason to be worried about this old movie house. The Music Hall is my ""next door"" theatre, and I'd hate to see it closed permamently.  I'd hate it even more if the roof caved in while I was watching a movie, mind you."	m

"urlLink China Daily :        ""Speaking at a forum on human rights development, which was held by the  China Foundation for Human Rights Development (CFHRD)  on Friday, Feng Jiancang, director of a human rights research center under the Ministry of Justice said China should enact the Law on Human Rights as soon as possible and formulate a pyramid-structured legal system to comprehensively protect human rights. ""      I do not exactly know what the director is trying to get at here. He speaks of the constitution at the Apex of this pyramid then the Law on Human Rights at the  upper middle  and 'other laws, such as Law on Women Interests Protection, Law on Teenagers Protection and Law on the Disabled, at the  lower middle  and all regulations on citizen's rights protection at the bottom' Feng tried to explain.   I do not particularly care if he is taking the famed Chinese ""scientific"" approach a little to far it is just good that this fairly foreign concept, ""Human Rights"" is getting aired at all."	m
"The junkie who sells stolen steaks. At least I'm pretty sure he's a junkie. Was pretty sure when his pants fell down just before he entered the door. He put down his shopping bags as he slowly pulled his pants up. He comes in the bar. Starts hitting up Steve the bartender. Steve has seen the stolen steak guy dealer before, and he doesn't want any stolen steaks. He just wants the fucker to leave. I want the guy to leave too. The guy wants $80 for $160 worth of steak. But he won't take ""no"" for an answer.   There are four guys at the bar, including me, and one lovely girl. I'm afraid the steak dealer is gonna scare the chick away. Hell, it's just nice to look at something other than the TV and a bunch of guys while you're drinking. You dig? And this girl has lovely breasts. And I can't help but looking at them while she writes in her little notebook.   And the steak dealer junkie motherfucker is getting in the way of my high. Here I am just wanting to get lost in the beauty of a single girl at the bar while drinking a beer. But this fucker is getting me down. My neck's tightening up. I think putting my hands behind the guy's head and forcing it into the bar repeatedly. I think about doing this because this guy is a lowlife scum. Jesus, peddling fucking stolen steaks to support your habit.   I try to think good thoughts. I try to focus on the girl. I want to be good. I try to be good, but one of these days I feel like I'm going bezerk and pull Billy Jack on someone. It's back to whole duality of man concept that I touched on last week with that bit from ""Full Metal Jacket."" The Jekyll and Hyde thing. I think we all have a bit of that in us. The good and evil. Dark and light. Ying and Yang and all that... I could go into this further, but I think the results might be futile at this present time.   Anyway, so the junkie asks Steve for some more ice for his ice tea. Why can't this fucker just leave, man? Just grab your Macy's bags full of steaks and get the fuck out of the bar, man. But he starts to roll a cigarette. He rolls it slow. He picks up his bags and heads for the door. But first he stops right near where the girl is sitting. He asks Steve for a book of matches. He puts a quarter on the bar. I'm inching my ass off the stool, ready to pounce on the fucker if he tries any bullshit with the girl. Fuck, just let the girl drink in peace. I'm sure she doesn't appreciate some junkie-ass stolen steak dealer rubbing up against her bare shoulder.   But finally the fucker leaves. He goes up the stairs outside. He stands at the top of the stairs. Puts his bags down. Takes a good few minutes to light his cigarette. I'm grateful the guy is gone."	m

I am amazed that I go to church and sometimes don't get to see the people who are in our college group, I mean they go to the same church and everything but it seems like it is a hit or miss sometimes. I got to hang out with most of the college and career today I realized how much I miss getting together to fellowship. I am really excited about college group starting up again. I am also excited about our girl's group, I am also scared because am I worthy enough to be teaching a whole group of women? I know Hannah will have my back but it's like who am I? Just Cela! I pray that it won't be about my teaching or guidance but about what God wants to do, building prayer warriors in the woman. I also pray that relationships will be built and that we can support and encourage each other throughout the week.	f

completely overwhelmed today.  i have a group of contractors that i have somehow been made responsible for that keep (meaning, the project manager is in another state!) asking for all sorts of things.  power strips, access cards, backup applications, new chairs, email accounts!  ugh!  did i sign up for this?  i don't think so.  i'm trying to restore some files for a guy at work and it isn't working...probably because the weekend backups haven't been working for a while.  there is so much information being backed up on the nt side, that it takes four tapes and is backing up during production on mondays!  therefore, we might not even have a backup of what he needs....argh!  on top of all that, i'm trying to handle any other calls that come in.	f
"OK, this creeped me out. A bit too close to home, folks.     Dirksen Federal Building   Chicago, IL   Photo ©  urlLink Chicago Tribune      Ill. Man Accused of Courthouse Bomb Plot   By NATHANIEL HERNANDEZ Associated Press Writer    Published August 5, 2004, 5:03 PM CDT    CHICAGO -- A convicted counterfeiter with an apparent grudge against the courts was arrested Thursday on charges of plotting to blow up a federal courthouse, but he never actually had materials to make a truck bomb, authorities said.  Prosecutors said Gale William Nettles, 66, was arrested with a pickup truck containing 1,500 pounds of fertilizer that he allegedly thought was volatile ammonium nitrate, the farm chemical used to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building.  Nettles had planned to sell the chemical to terrorists who would blow up the Dirksen federal building, U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald said in announcing the charges Thursday. But all the other people involved, including the ""terrorists"" and the people who sold him the fertilizer, were cooperating witnesses or federal agents, Fitzgerald said.  Nettles told the undercover agent he could make a 3,000-pound fertilizer bomb.  ""He had a rational plan to build a bomb. We weren't going to wait to see if it would work,"" Fitzgerald said.  Timothy McVeigh used a bomb made of 4,800 pounds of ammonium nitrate to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people.  Nettles was arrested at a park early Thursday with the pickup truck when he met the undercover agents who he thought were terrorists, according to the criminal complaint. The fertilizer he obtained in the sting does not have the explosive potential of ammonium nitrate.  According to the complaint, Nettles met July 26 with an undercover agent he thought was a member of a terrorist group. In a recorded meeting, Nettles said he had a half ton of ammonium nitrate in New Orleans that he could have in Chicago in two days and that he had a target in mind -- the U.S. courthouse downtown, the complaint said.  A federal magistrate Thursday ordered Nettles held until a detention hearing Tuesday. No plea was entered, and defense attorney John Theis declined to comment afterward.  Nettles was released from prison in 2003 after serving time for counterfeiting and apparently retained a grudge against the court system, Fitzgerald said. The Dirksen federal building in downtown Chicago houses federal criminal and civil courts and the U.S. attorney's office.  Fitzgerald said Nettles was not working with any other groups but had asked cooperating witnesses about contacting Al-Qaida and Hamas.  Nettles also had a previous conviction for armed robbery in Cook County and was on parole at the time of his counterfeiting arrest. In 2001 he claimed he had mental disabilities, according to court documents.  ""He's 66 and he's spent -- probably conservatively -- 45 of those years in prison,"" said attorney Ronald J. Clark, who represented Nettles in the counterfeiting case. ""It surprises me that Gale would seriously be involved in something of this magnitude,"" Clark said. He described Nettles' counterfeiting as a ""fairly pathetic attempt.""  Nettles had been living at a transient hotel in Chicago since his release following the counterfeiting sentence, authorities said. Sam Gelles, 35, another hotel resident, said Nettles was an introverted computer whiz who went by the nickname ""Pops."" ""You couldn't really read him,"" Gelles said.

Okay, well although I have nothing interesting to say... Someone does.        I taste like  Peanut Butter .   I am one of the most blendable flavours; I go with sweet, I go with sour, I go with bland, I go with anything. I am practical and good company, but have something of a tendency to hang around when I'm not wanted, unaware that my presence is not welcome.  What Flavour Are You?      I was looking at Andrew's site and found out what flavour I am. No matter what I did I was always peanut butter. So, figure out what flavour you are too.	f
It is funny that you drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway.  Also, I get high on a freeway, but freebase on a highway.  Curious.  Anyway, the Mariners have so much potential.  Promising start last night by rookie Clint Nageotte (pronounced na-zhot) who gave up 0 runs in six innings.  The largest Mariner problem has been synchronizing offense and defense (one has one f, the other has two).  Mariner's starters Joel Pinero and Freddy Garcia each have excellent ERA's, yet abismal records.  Lastly, the Pistons can beat the Lakers, and I see the finals as a tossup.  Anyone that thinks the Lakers are going to coast by anther lame-ass eastern conference team has another thing coming.  That thing is the ridiculously powerful Wallace and Wallace combo, Tayshaun Prince guarding Kobe, and my boy Rip Hamilton who took a page out of Jesse T's book and wears the Hannibal mask on his way to being the Piston's postseason leading scorer.  I prefer my TP hanging under, and I'll fight that to the death with Biblical references to back it up.  Love, Rob  P.S.  To all you concerned little kiddies in blogger land, Mary and I are good friends and remain to be good friends.  Last night we saw the Presidents of The United States of America play the Rose Festival.  I can say with 100% confidence it was the best concert I've ever seen for $5.  Long live Lump, Kitty, Peaches, and The Groovin Postman.	m
"My family asked me to choose some verses to read at my grandma's mass tomorrow. The priest is going to read the gospel verses and I'm going to read the other ones:   ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.""  Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?""  Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.""  -John 14:1-7   Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.  -Romans 5:1-5   Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.   ""To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?"" says the Holy One.   Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, ""My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God""?  Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.  -Isaiah 40:21-31"	f
"*****  After my book group on Wednesday evening, I received the following message on my voicemail: ""Last week you chose door number 3 but opted out. Better make it this week"". It was TJ MAXX, harassing me about going dancing with him at some new bar-club on Polk. Since I already had plans to take Thursday off, I called him back and told him I'll pick him up at 10:45. Despite my initial hesitation about going and my predictions of spending 3 hours watching scenesters trying to out-cool each other, it turned into an pretty fun night. Me, TJ, TJ's ex MK, JJ Fad's ex and her new girlfriend, all completely smashed and dancing to early 90's hits by such talented singer-songwriters as En Vogue, Digital Underground and Sir Mix-A-Lot as well as some new stuff. I was seeing double by the time we left, so I asked TJ to drive. At his house 15 scary minutes later, he revealed that he, too, was completely wasted and was 'just trying to do what all the other cars were doing'. Thank you lord jesus for getting us safely to TJ's abode. So that was Wednesday.   On Thursday, anticipating a day of much needed rest and relaxation, I drove home, called in sick, and got into my soft warm bed. Ten minutes later, Marcus called and told me to be ready to go to the sweatshop in 45 minutes. Fuck!!, I thought, that's why I took the day off, not to nurse my monster hangover. At the factory, Marcus explained to me how the whole operation works. I tried to pay attention, but all the machines were too intriguing, so every ten minutes I took breaks and ran around the floor. I had to hold myself back from jumping into the enormous piles of felt and cotton scraps on the floor. After that, Marcus got me my very own Costco card and we went out to lunch in chinatown. Then it was time to go to chem class.   It's finally Friday and I'm counting minutes until I can go home and veg out in my pajamas. Mike is back on Sunday. After finishing his scarf, I decided to keep it for myself, so I have to churn out another one by then. In addition to all the other stuff I was planning to get him for christmas but never did. He wrote that he lost weight in the last 6 weeks so maybe I'll roast a chicken on Sunday or something."	f

I have applied at all the places in town that I can. I have a feeling that the only way I am going to find work is to leave Monmouth. I know our car won't make it to Galesburg, but I really need to get there in order to be able to work. I may have to leave this area all together in order to find work :O(  I am working on my smoking habit. I am trying to take my smoking back down to a pack a week like it was before I started smoking so much. I hope to be able to quit all together. I know it won't be easy, but it is costing us too much to support my habit. I just hope I won't turn into a gluttinous pig, well more then I already am :O), when I finally do quit.  Everything is going well on the pen pal front. I have many people writing me now :O) All of them are good people. I love the fact that they are all LGBT!

"Bill Gates died and went to heaven.  On arrival, he had to wait in the reception area. This was the size of Queensland, with literally millions of people milling about, living in tents with nothing to do all day. Food and water were being distributed from the backs of trucks; staffers with clipboards battled their way through the crowds. Booze and drugs were being passed around, fights were commonplace. Sanitation conditions were appaling, the whole thing looked like Woodstock gone metastic.  Bill lived in a tent for three weeks until, finally, a staffer approached him - a young man in his late teens with acne scars wearing a blue T - shirt with TEAM PETER written on it.  ""Hello."" said the staffer in a bored, bereaucratic sounding voice. ""My name is Gabriel and I'll be your induction co - ordinator.""  Bill started to ask a question but Gabriel interrupted him. ""No, I'm not the Archangel Gabriel, I'm just a guy from Melbourne named Gabriel. I died in a car crash at the age of 17. Now give me your name, last name first, unless your Chinese, in which case it's first name first.""  ""Gates, Bill""  Gabriel checked his clipboard.  ""Why are all these people here? Where is St Peter? Where are the pearly gates?""  Gabriel ignored his questions until he located his entry on his clipboard. ""It says here you were the president of a large software company. Is that right?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well then, do the maths, chip head. When heaven opened, only 100 people or so died every day. St Peter could handle them all himself, no problems. No there are over 5 billion people on earth. Jesus, when God said go forth and multiply, he didn't mean like rabbits! Now around 10,000 people die every hour, over a quarter of a million people every day. Do you think Peter can meet them all personally?""  ""I guess not.""  ""You guessed right."" So Peter had to franchise the operation. He's now the CEO of Team Peter Enterprises Inc. Just sits in the Corporate Headquarters and sets policy. Franchisees like me handle the actual inductions. Your paperwork seems to be inorder and with a background like yours, you'll be getting a plum job assignment.""  ""Job assignment?""  ""Of course. Did you expect to spend the rest of eternity sitting on your arse and drinking ambrosia? Heavens a big operation. And you have to pull your weight."" Gabriel had Bill sign a form in triplicate, then tore out the middle copy and handed it to him. ""Take this form to Induction Centre 23 and meet up with your Occupational Orientator. His name is Abraham.""  Bill started to ask a question. Gabriel interrupted ""No, he's not that Abraham.""  Gates walked down a long, muddy trail until he came to Induction Centre 23. After a mere six hour wait he met Abraham.  ""Heaven is centuries behind in it's data processing infrastructure."" explained Abraham. Were still doing everything on paper. It takes us a week to process new entries. Your job will be to supervise Heaven's new Data Processing Centre. We're putting in the largest computing facility in the history of creation. Half a million computers connected by a multi segment, fibre optic network, all running into a back end server with one thousand parallel Cyrix CPU's on a two gigabyte channel. Fully fault tolerant. Fully distributed processing. The works!""  ""Wow!"" said Bill. ""What a great job. This really is Heaven!""  Abraham and Bill caught the shuttle bus and went to Heaven's new Data Processing Centre. It was a truly huge facility, 100 times the size of the SCG, with workmen crawling all over it. And in the middle, arranged in huge circles around a massive, house sized mainframe, were half a million computers in neat rows. Half a million.  ""Macintoshes!"" exclaimed Bill, horrified.  ""All running ClarisWorks software. Not a single byte of Microsoft code. "" said Abraham.  The thought of spending the rest of eternity using products hed spent his life trying to destroy was too much for Bill. ""What about PC's?"" he exclaimed. ""What about Windows? What about Excel? What about Word?""  ""This is Heaven"", explained Abraham. We need a computer system that's heavenly to use. If you want to build a data processing centre based on PC's running Windows, then GO TO HELL!"""	m

"Latest in a series: more free stuff from the Dean.  She's expanded wireless access.  I think I may be the only student here without a wireless card.  But anyway.  She included this message in her e-mail -- which, since I don't have a wireless card doesn't affect me anyway, but:   Second and equally important, students should not use the wireless  network during class unless a professor specifically has authorized such use.  Violation of this rule is harmful to the learning process and disrespectful to both faculty and fellow students.  Except when the professor determines that access to the network will enhance the  educational experience, the classroom is not an appropriate place to make use of network service.  Given the law school's paramount goal of providing the finest possible education to all its students, I cannot stress enough the importance of this restriction. I want to know in what class access to the network will enhance the learning experience.

Well today is the last day I will be at my parents’ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so we’ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down there…. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my god…. Let’s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!)   After that, we continued our journey south. I read a book that mum had given- Crossing Over by John Edward. It was an interesting read- however I found it to be very similar to watching the television show in parts. I actually do believe in the things he writes about. Call me crazy, but sometimes I do feel as though the presence of those departed are around me. Also, at funerals- I never feel upset. I usually (well ALWAYS) get the feeling that the spirit of the deceased is around me, and that they are very much happier where they are. So I am the one trying to hide my smile when everyone else is upset. I do feel it is inappropriate that I feel strangely happy at funerals for those that die- but the way I see it- they are no longer suffering on earth anymore, and they are much happier where they are now. I don’t think many people understand the way I think about these things- and I know I have offended many as well. But hey- each to their own- I respect the thoughts of others on this matter, and thankfully, most respect mine as well.  Back to the bus trip! We stopped for lunch at some place called Koumala. I wondered if this was some sort of Greek name or is this meant something naughty in another language… probably not I imagined… Koumala is really just a roadhouse with really expensive food in it. I ended up just getting some more lollies to eat. I was not going to pay excessive amounts of money for something that was likely to taste crap.  Back on the bus again, and we passed through some more really really small towns. The landscape did not change much once we passed through Sarina and left the sugar cane country. Near sunset I looked out the window and saw a couple of wild kangaroos. Some of the backpackers on the bus were a bit excited about that!  Then finally, at about 6:15, we pulled into Rockhampton. It was still really warm there, probably mid 20’s. I went to get some milk from Doblos- a local independent retailer. I had wanted to go there because during summer, I saw on  a current affairs show (Today Tonight) that they were offering fuel vouchers (save 10c off per litre) to anyone who bought over $30 worth of goods from their stores. It made the news show because the local Safeway (locally known as Woolworths here) was matching it. (Everywhere else in Australia the discount is 4c per litre). Anyway I was disappointed to learn that the discount here was now only 6cper litre, and only able to be used at local petrol stations. Oh well, next time.  From there we went and visited one of my cousins and had dinner. I don’t know what it is about Queenslanders- but they seem to make interesting interpretations of all sorts of food. This time it was Lemon Chicken, but not how I am used to it in Melbourne. The lemon sauce here seemed to be creamy in texture and looks, and taste. This was something a bit unusual for me, as I am used to the lemon sauce being transparent, and a yellow colour. The rice was much starchier than I am used to as well. I should not bitch about this though, as I used to make food like this as well while I was still living up here. Anyway, because I was so hungry, I had 2 servings.   After that, it was off to my grandparents (otherwise known as ‘the farm’.) I suppose I cannot really call it my grandparents, as my grandfather (on mothers side of the family) died over 7 years ago, and my grandmother lives here with 4 of her sons (my uncles)- who have never permanently moved away (that I am aware of at least!). So I think I will just call it the farm from now onwards.   On the way out, I was absolutely amazed by all the stars I could see in the sky. I had thought I could see a lot of stars from the Western suburbs- but it is nothing compared to what you can see from this part of the world. There was no moon in the sky at all, yet the sky seemed to have a whitish tinge to it- not absolutely black. I could clearly see the milky way- beautiful in its appearance. I thought I could even see the comet that is visiting our skies at the moment! By the time we reached the farm though (just after 10:30pm), I did not wish to go sky gazing anymore. I just wanted to go to bed.   I went straight to bed- without even having a shower or washing my hair. I never do this, especially when my hair has freeze gel through it (and has had it in there all day!) But I was just too tired. Just after 11pm- I closed my eyes and went to sleep.	m

"Hmm, Blogger seemed to have updated the GUI once again. Now I don't need to look up the ""img src ="" for images HTML tag again, woohoo! Also, you can change font, but the funny thing is, the default font is Georgia which is my preferred font, so no changes there!

It seems like we are trying really hard to figure out exactly what makes a good community, so I started thinking about Biology again.  In an environmental community, let's say a rotting log, the fungus and animals and bugs are working together differently and perfectly to decompose the wood.  But they have no idea that they are a community because it's us who recognize this by observing them.  So it seems like maybe if we just do what we know best (different talents God has given us) and quit trying so hard, the outside world will be able to observe and define how solid a community we are.	f

"I can't go without mentioning all the unintentional Matt (Wilson) coverage. I am saddened because Brad looked like shit (and Phil, I believe, even described Brad as being broken). But, so much Matt! I know I'm horrible, really. But I enjoy seeing my favorite cyclist on national TV.  The word of the day is  not  Lance (okay -- it is OLN-wise, but not me-wise), but instead, it's ""ouch."" Tyler, Mario, Bernhard and others. All the different peloton breaks were really interesting to watch. Granted, though, at the end there were only two: the main peloton and Brad and Matt. This is the first time I've seen a tour from the beginning. Before last year, I'd only watched highlights. And then, last year, I started watching on Stage 12.  I do have some complaints about OLN's coverage. With tennis, even ESPN can tell you all the completed matches. But OLN? Apparently they find no need to tell me where all the riders are after each stage. The only way I knew Matt was 181st was because they showed a little (two lines) summary of him while he was helping Brad. Although I know that Matt is probably 187th of 188. And, sadly, Brad is 188th (EDIT: I learned when I finally got home, that Matt was actually 186th and Brad 187th, because poor Nick Gates didn't make the cut.)  Although my TV watching has been split between the Wimbledon finals (Gah. Roger. I wanted Andy to win) and the stage, I fully enjoyed and appreciated the rain-filled racing.   Also, if Al complains one more time about the lack of Lance coverage, I'm going to write an email (EDIT: Oddly enough, he never did). I wish they would show a little more respect for the other 187 riders.   Enough complaining. I truly enjoyed the final sprint. I must admit that I kind of expected Petacchi to win, but it was almost clear that the Fassa Bortolo train was not completely in control and thus didn't allow enough of a leadout for Petacchi.  (Quotes: The virus of cycling - Al. Ride to live, live to ride - Bob)  Other things I liked? The Thor-Tom-Fabian points fight. Jaan Kirsipuu (if only because his name is so much fun to say out loud). All the Matt (sorry Brad). Getting to see April's boys: Hondo and Baden. Fighting-Erik (don't give up, Erik!) Robbie losing (I am evil, I know). And, well, the rain. I'm a sucker for bad weather. I totally enjoy the excitement. Though, after Benhard's crash, I spent a lot of time praying that Matt wouldn't crash."	f
"Yes, yes, spank away i have not blogged in a few days!  My brother was let off with 1 year prob. and a 500 doller fine. Turns out that his crazy chick was seeing things and he had no gun or anything else! Please hope that i dont see her, shelle be less  than nice. My mom took off to Hardy Arkansas so that when he got out of jail she would not see him. She knows that he would try to come around and she needed a break. Cant say that i blame her much! She will be back in time for my Bar-B-Q.  Speaking of my bar-b-que, i am streching myself to the limit trying to get everything togther and in order for this thing.  I talked to Thomas about it last night when he called, i was saying that i was kinda stressed out about everything that needs to get done. I felt that i did not have enough time to get everything together! And he said "" that is a sign of a good host"". That made me feel so good, because i really never thought that anyone paid any attention. Its the little things, No one ever just stops and says, wow. eh.... mabye i should stop trying so hard to make everything nice.  Today for lunch i went to Kens house to pick up mikas cage, sarah is getting her puppy today and i am letting her borrow it. I am so excited for her, seeing how her other one died. She can crate train this one, like i did mika!  Vehicle Fleet class today!"	f
WAMP/Virtools  Well I got Apache, MySQL and PHP working here, I also got a nice  urlLink forum  to start with. It is a very simple PHP/MySQl based forum, and so far it is working with a virtools window inside. I just found out that I need to figure out a way to update the browser window without resetting the virtools window. There are two ways I can think of: 1. put the player on a seperate page 2. restore the latest settings on the player everytime the page changes  Since I had admin rights for a short time, I've managed to install some useful applications on my computer to get it a bit more workable, a multi desktop application, which isn't nearly as good as the default X one, let alone my enhanced Gnome one, but it gives my at least some more desktop space.	m

"Spyware supplier WhenU recently  urlLink obtained an injunction against a Utah law that would ban spyware .    I really have mixed feelings on this, because it's a battle of two groups I'm not fond of - spyware perveyors and people who have no idea how to use a computer.  I work at a college helpdesk, and I regularly see computers with tons of popups, multiple ""toolbars"", ect - we've had students where  urlLink AdAware  has found around 1000 objects.  It has a huge cost in terms of time and user aggrivation.  On the other hand, much of the spyware that gets installed is because of poor user practices - unpatched machines, downloading and installing well-known spyware-laden programs like Kazaa, clicking on any install box that comes up, ect.  I rarely have problems with my home or work PC's, because I'm good about keeping them up to date and because I practice safe surfing.  I worry when the government steps in and takes away any rights, even when those rights annoy people.  What is going to solve spyware is not laws, but educated computer users.  Of course, when the average computer user becomes smart enough avoid spyware, pigs will be all up in the sky."	m

"So last night, Jeff and I tore off into the night in my dad's midlife crisis Sebring convertible.  It's such a cherry toy.  The fact that the top comes down just makes the cassette player seem almost bearable (I have one of those portable-CD player converter things, don't worry).  We headed up to  urlLink CONNIE'S  house so I could drop some stuff off for her mom.  On the way back, Jeff and I intended to hit the Tasty-Freeze in Grayslake.  We hadn't been there in years.  Then we started reliving the moments we had over a few summers.  We talked about the torture we put on my old green Chevy Blazer (that truck didn't even have a tape deck, just the radio!), and Jeff's good old red Rodeo (with the infamous speaker setup).  We were simply amazed by the fact that for the most part, those cars came out unscathed.  Driving over HUGE curbs, flying over the railroad tracks on Atkinson, driving through soccer fields, swimming through the water hole behind some Chinese restaurant in Vernon Hills.  The nights Jeff and I would take off and driving into the city via the Sheridan Road route and then walk around downtown.  Those were the days, back when there wasn't enough room in the trucks so someone had to sit all the way in back.  Those were the days.  Jeff and I actually headed off Dairy Dream in Libertyville, but they closed at the RIDICULOUS hour of 8 pm.  That meant we had to sell out and motor to the Dairy QUEEN, a horrid Libertyville teenage hangout.  So we pull in, lookin' all boss in the Sebring.  We strut up to the counter where there's the expected 80-degree-evening line.  We end up in a line behind the dreaded high school dumbasses.  Apparently they know the NASTY little girl working behind the counter.  The conversation was filled with quotes like, ""I saw a Lamborghini here.""  That's great dumbass, order and leave.  She finally took care of the honors society and it was our turn.  Jeff orders a SNICKERS Blizzard and he was later certain it was a ""sand and gravel"" Blizzard.  It was probably Heath.  I ordered the my usual (but deadly) Nerds Blizzard, the little skank goes, ""Do you like Nerds?""  No ape-girl, I LOVE order food I don't like.  Being that dad let me use his toy, I had to pay him in the only currency my father understands.  Pie.  Jeff and I rolled on to the local Bakers Square where we sat in the parking lot eating our ice cream.  We laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation in the moments between Jeff spitting rocks from his ice cream.  Jeff said, ""This Blizzard wouldn't have been so bad if the girl wasn't ugly and slow.""  Amen Jeff.  It was just a good night, relaxed and slow, not a god damn care in the world.  That is what it's all about and that is what we live for."	m
"Still devastated about Tom Stofka’s death.  But life goes on.  A bunch of us went out last night for food and drinks, and we talked about Tom as well as other things.  I think the camaraderie helped us cope.  In his honor, American flags in Brooklyn’s parks are at half-mast.  So how about the shit hitting the fan about the abuse treatment of Iraqi prisoners?  Rumsfeld is in trooouuubbbllleee...  Apparently, Rumsfeld knew about it for months and hid the reports from Bush.  Yesterday, Bush had to actually use the word “sorry”.  This administration never apologizes for anything!  We very may well have a new Secretary of Defense before it’s all said and done.  And now a few TV commentaries.   1) Big Tom Buchanan was voted off of “Survivor” last night.  He could have played the role of a crucial swing vote but neither alliance felt they could trust him for the duration.  The final four is now Boston Rob, Amber, Rupert and Jenna with the finale to be aired on Sunday night.   2) I caught the last half-hour of “Friends” last night and was not impressed.  I never really watched the show to begin with and couldn’t care less that it’s off the air. 3) The season finale of “The O.C.” was the other night.  For the first time, a party on that show did not end with a fistfight or someone getting thrown into a pool.  Very sad ending though with Ryan going back to Chino out of obligation, and against his wishes.  I think it’s pretty clear though that he’ll move back to the Cohen’s house very early next season.  And what was with Seth sailing off into the sunset?  Gabe raises a good point, he’ll probably wind up drowning! 4) “24” is down to its last few episodes and Tony Almeida’s character has absolutely lost it.  Blackmailed by the bad guy, Tony has betrayed his country and directly put the lives of millions at risk.  Can’t wait for Jack to dole out his brand of justice.  A litany of bullets in Tony’s head perhaps?  Worked for Nina.  How bout those Mets?  They still stink but at least they swept the San Francisco Giants.  Guess the Giants aren’t much of team when Barry Bonds doesn’t play.  And my Fantasy Baseball team is even doing a little better.  If you can call 5th/6th place a little better.  I really want to see ""Super Size Me"", the documentary about the guy who only eats McDonalds for 30 days.    Have a good weekend!"	m
at the bidding of my friend and financial advisor (although, i think he quit after i paid to see 'the day after tomorrow' for the second time...who can blame him?) and in the hopes of becoming less of a financial paraiah and possibly taking one baby step towards adulthood, i requested a copy of my credit report.   there's nothing that can make you feel like more of a total fuckup than seeing in black and white courrier typeface every single one of your fiscal missteps.  and of course, they put the whole damn 5 page letter in bold, all-caps just so you're not mistaken that you are a very very bad person.    dear transunion,   i get it.  i know that i'm a horrible person who deserves nothing more than to be left for dead in the desert, at the mercy of the sun and wild dogs.  i swear, i didn't mean to rack up a whopping $149 in debt at macy's in 1997.  i'm sure nothing i bought then is worth the lifetime of pain and suffering i seem to have accrued at the ripe old age of 25.  if i could, i would totally return it.  please forgive me.  love, aimee  yeah.  i'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.  the road to hell is paved with sales recipts.  and i'm more than halfway there.  it looks like i've got a lot of scrimping and saving in store for me.  but, hey!  i'm already saving myself money as i type.  i'm home sick today (this time i'm actually sick...if you can believe it.  i hate being home sick when i'm sick.  what's the fun in that?  there isn't even anyone around to feel sorry for me and make me tea.)  but, being home sick does have its advantages.  for instance, i'm not putting myself into harm's way by walking past countless shops.  i'm on the road to recovery here, people...  oh, who am i kidding?  my life sucks.    and i think it's going to rain today.  bah!	f

"I just got off the phone with my cousin, who filled me in on the crazy antics of my Maryland cousins...way too much to go into here and now, it suffices to say it involved a deliberate fire, a high speed chase, and fourteen $25 dollar air fresheners.  Reecey-pooh is in town this week; for his spring break he is shadowing a woman who is a lobbyist for the Urban League.  He wants to be an education lobbyist.  Reece and I would have cute kids, too bad we have always just been friends...  Its not like I want anything to change between us, I am simply commenting that we would have attractive kids.  We are the same color of golden honey brown, and we are both tall, and Reece has a cute nose too.  We went to Gordon Biersch (sp?) for dinner with Anne, which was cool.  I think Reece and I will be friends forever, even though that sounds so fifth grade, I really do think so, we'll probably bring our families over to eachothers houses for barbecues and cute stuff like that.  My crush on SK is getting worse.  By worse I mean I am thinking about him a lot lately, uggh it is frustrating, I will probably get bored with in the first month of something with him.  That is how it always is, I meet someone - date them - its exciting for a few weeks - then it gets boring and I lose interest and it stops being exciting and I dont know how to end it - unless I just disappear off the face of the planet.  And he probably wouldnt date me anyways.:(  My relationship with Darien is virtually nonexistent.  I mean we talk but not really and we dont see eachother much.  He is in FL this week for his spring break.  It is so hard to broach the subject of ending this with him, I dont know why I am such a chicken-sh*t.  I know I owe him some type of explanantion.  This is the truth, what I will never say to Darien: ""Darien I think our relationship is based solely on sex, good sex, well great sex, but only on sex nonetheless.  And I am looking for something more, I am looking for someone who I can talk to who can talk to me, and who doesnt litter.  And I want to be in  a serious relationship, I really do, like some leading to marriage forever really in love type shit.  Even if in the end it doesnt work out.  And this isnt it, nor will it ever be.  In this relationship I feel dead inside, I feel numb, my feelings for you are not growing into love, not the inlove type of love at least.  Like I wouldnt want to tell you all of this because I dont really think you are a bad guy, not at all, just one with some issues that I would rather not deal with.  And the thing that makes me really want to force myself to say these things is that I think you are looking for me to love you, that you thought that that is what would happen eventually, but now that you see how bad I treat you, you are unsure, and hey if all ellse fails you are thinking at least the sex was fucking fantastic, as in fantastic fucking!  I do not want you to get your feelings hurt, I dont want you to feel unwanted or inadequate, I want you to feel loved and respected and needed.  But I dont feel that way, and I need to let you go, because being with you scares me, it scares me a lot, because the longer I am with you, the more I wonder if I will ever feel that way, that in-love-need-you-cant-wait-to-see-you-hear-you-touch-you feeling again.  And I need that, I need that very much."""	f
"I got thrown in the pool tonight for the first time! I know I know it's against the rules to throw Cela in but it happened thanks to Jonathan and Abraham. 6 times between the two of them I went in clothes and everything. The funny thing is I brought a swimsuit but I never got to put it on. Ben didn't even save me, I was horrified. :) Luckily though Jonathan and Abraham didn't just throw me in like any other person I was gently thrown in. Nice of them, huh? After the fifth time I was like, ""Stop picking of the easiest person to throw in!"" I think I actually kicked someone in the face. It was weird because although I don't like getting thrown in it made me feel like one of them in a way, like I am not left out anymore. So that was cool and I got a chance to talk to Gracie and her friend coming in and out of the pool. Bonding time with the youth, how awesome is that?! And afterwards when the dj was playing his music I got some of the kids to do the cha cha slide with me, and the other great dances that I love. Gracie, Abraham, and one of their friends all ran up to the front when the Macarena came on and were like, ""come on Cela let's go!"" hee hee. I feel so loved. So there is my story funny but it has an awesome ending."	f
Let me break down one of the crappiest days in recent memory. First I had to drag around textbooks in my backpack all day so it weighed like 10000000000000000000 pounds. Then I got to hear about some more gross STDs which made me feel real good about sex. Then in guitar I remembered I had to take home my guitar today so I had to text message my mom telling her to pick me up. Then in third period we read our letters that our parents wrote to us in August. My dad wrote some really nice stuff but for some reason I got really sad. Then in Math we had a Big 25 that nobody knew about. I was supposed to serve lunch detention today but I didn't. We had a test in Mr. Moser but we ended up talking about politics all period which is ok with me. In history we had a test and even though it was open-book I still think I did bad. At the end of sixth period we had to go to our homeroom from the beginning of the year. I had to go to Mr. Ryder who is like my favorite teacher. Atleast I got to talk to Jason during that time. Then I was planning on saying my final goodbye to Stacey...maybe a kiss or SOMETHING! But nooooo.....I couldn't even do that because since we had to go to our homerooms, after school I couldn't find where Stacey was...I looked all over. She told me that she was waiting by the stairs and then she went to my bus. So I must have looked by the stairs while she was at my bus. She looked for me by the bus but I was a car rider today. FUCK!! Im so pissed. Things just happened to work out in all the wrong ways today. Oh and I was supposed to spend the night at Austin's house but tonight his mom just changed her mind out of the blue and said that I couldn't. Now I am trying to call Stacey but I can't get through....today was fucked. *sigh*	m
"My neck hurts so bad!! Oh well,  I  have had worse. One time..well..let  me give some back ground. For some reason at my old house I could never  sleep   on  my bed. After just laying there for a couple of hours trying to fall asleep I would just end up  rolling  off my bed onto the floor [the rolling part was kinda fun!!] and then I would fall right asleep. See, our house was awesome. We had heated   floors !!! So  when  you would lay on the carpet it would be toasty and warm!! It rocked. In this house whenever  I  walk on the floors early in the morning I am like ""Brrrr!!!"" because I can totally  tell  a huge difference.  So, most nights I would sleep on our carpet. One night for some odd reason I slept totally weird. I woke up and I could not move. Like, at all. The only body part I could move was like my fingers. It was a sunday so we had to go to church and  my friends  and  I  would always run around and be crazy but I couldn't becuase it hurt so bad.   That  really stunk.    Today  I took a  super long shower. It was nice. But, the water was never the right temperature!!! I totally need to invent a  shower  that right when you turn it on it knows who you are and exactly what temperature you like so it heats up to that temperature. Wouldn't that rock?  I  think so.  Then I blow dryed my hair. My hair is growing so much!!! i  bet my the end of this school year it's going to be the same length it was before I  cut  it! Woohhoo!! Shot hair is nice and all, but I love long hair.  Did I tell you what i'm going to do next summer? At the very beginning I am going to get it don't in a TON of little braids! Woohoo! Then I will  never have to style it or anything!  I am quite excited.  but that's a long ways away.  Oh well.   I hope this  school  year is fun. I am starting to get scared, very scared. What if  everyone hates  me???  I don't see why they would or anything...but there are always those what if's.  I hope I find a lot of friends. Because Katie and Heather will be like the best of friends...so then there is me. I will eat   lunch  with them and everything but they have like so much sutff that's well..inside  I  guess. Like the two of them know everything about eachother. I bet Katie G. and I will  grow  really close becuase we are both good friends with Katie and Heather but we don't know all the  inside  information.  I wonder if we will have any classes together. because Katie G., Heather, and Katie are all in Algebra 2 and I am in Geomtry. Yuck. I think Katie and I might have history together though so that should be fun. History rocks.  I wanna be  a  history  teacher!  That would be fun.   I  want to teach Junior High because I want to be able to help those kids while they are in weird times.  it's  funny  how I am refering to Junior Highers as kids considering I was one yet a year and a half ago.  It seems like such a long time ago!!!   I  didn't really   like  junior high. It was my first year of real school so it was kind of scary. I got messsed up friends. At first they all said they were Christians but they totally didn't act like  Christians.  It was sad. I wonder where they are now. We kinda parted ways and lost touch, I hope they are ok.   [Did you see the secret message? Hahahhahahahha!!]"	f
YW pulled my hair!!!! i mean, we haven't talk like, in ages, and she just came and pulled my hair!!!???  We used to be friends. To me, she's a good friend. but maybe she didn't think the same about me, though. i mean, nowadays, we don't talk much and whenever we have the chance, i just blurt something not so nice. i mean, i was trying to be sarcastic, here!   i'm always like that to people who i regard as a good friend anyway...  Okay, so i was not that mad that she pulled my hair. but she didn't look so happy...actually, kinda angry (i mean seriously angry) when i told her to go and die...  But that was what we used to talk like! (or at least, how i talk like to best friends) Maybe i'm around shirley too much...  I'm actually kinda glad that she make an attempt to err, interact again, but why does she have to pull my hair? i'm soooo very sensative about my hair. i mean, you can tease me about everything and i'll still laugh my head off, but if you touch my hair, you're gonna be sooooo dead.  i'm worried that she'll take the 'go and die' comment seriously. she did look upset. Arrrghhhhh. (Rika bangs her head on the table)  Maybe i should keep my mouth shut next time. Or at least try not to act too familiar. You know, she's a really nice friend and all, i just wonder how or, why we drift apart this year. *sigh* i really want to talk to her like we used to again. but oh well.   i honestly sincerely truthfully and really, really hope she's not angry.	f

"Well, I guess today I get my ""I survived the teenage years"" badge for my Moms merit collection.

"When I was prompted to give the name for this blog I typed down wereallgonnadie. Perhaps there are those of you who are the type who like to know why somethings have the names they do. Like why is the Williamsburg Bridge in NYC named ""The Williamsburg Bridge"". Or why the McDonalds red-haired dude is named 'Ronald' instead of 'Weird-scary-clown-dude'. Whatever, I'm going to give you the insight to why this blog is named the way it is.   Probably soon before I had started to created this blog I had thought of the many things that may kill us Americans in the years to come. I thought about  urlLink near earth objects ,  urlLink famine ,  urlLink AIDS ,  urlLink multiple wars and unrests ,  urlLink global warming ,  urlLink environmental degradation ,  urlLink the end of fossil fuels  and plain old stupid people. Oh yeah and don't forget todays popular favorite:  urlLink Islamic terrorists . By the way there are other possible causes too, these are just the ones I though of right away today. There's nothing like waking up to another bright new day full of endless possible ways that you can meet your demise. Damn Dog, You feel me? Back to the subject, so in the moment right before hitting submit on the blog creation I thought: ""We're all gonna die"". That's it! Tie this little tidbit into the time a few days ago when I typed in wereallgonnadie.com and a website came up (for a rocking metal band) and there you have the name for me. I even have a band named after my blog. Ok I know they did come first.   So, we're all going to die. It's true, I swear. I guess your mommy didn't want to tell you this but she didn't talk to you about sex either did she? She's was always trying to keep the good info from you, that and where she hid the Halloween candy.   Anways, I'm putting all of my money on Jesus. Any takers?"	m

"The following are some of my new words.  Yes some of them are stolen from my friends, but oh well.  The first part (before the ""/"") is the english pronunciation, and the second (after the ""/"") is the real spelling (for words in different languages).   urlLink This  is a good site for finding some good words.   szhamma/llama - I'm not sure what it means, if anything, but evidently in argentinean ""ll"" is pronounced like a soft J.  In german, it would be spelled ""schamma.""  Szhamma is usually used as an exclamation, such as ""Szhamma!"" although it can also be used as a noun, i.e. ""Don't be a szhamma.""  pasae/passer - Also a french word, I have no clue what this one means either, but I do know it's an infinitive form verb.  Since I know it's a verb, I decided to use it as a verb, although, like szhamma, it means next to nothing.  By the way, in german, it'd be ""paßee.""  (dee) gesheershpoolmachina/(die) Geschirrspülmaschine - German for dishwasher.  Just altogether a cool word.  Just a side note, the umlauted ""ü"" is pronounced more like ""eww"" than ""oo"" but it's a subtle difference.  fishsticks - A word Erik Johnson used to say all the time, it's similar to ""Shoot!"" and can't be used for good things.  peaches  peachy - Peaches I use similarly to fishsticks, except with good things.  Peachy is a synonym to super or great.  mofo - I'm sure many of you know what this word is short for, and that it generally means a good friend, similar to ""homey"" although to me sometimes it means what it really is short for.  Kustom Fooder - A phrase we used a lot in ABS today, one of the wisefools came up with it.  I'm sure you can guess it means ""Custom Footer""  wisefool - synonymous to sophmore, which does in fact mean wise fool in some language.  I use it as a noun for sophs as well as an insult to anyone who's not one.  hoser - an idiot.    Lunch was quite interesting today.  Angie and her ""Jo-Jo Po-Ta-Toes"" and that she ""wants to beat Mr. Thompson with a polish sausage.""  And then Logan decides to mix things up and asks Luke if he would make out with Mary; he said ""I'd rather make out with a cow.""  Well not to be outdone, Logan says ""What's the difference?""  I didn't hear it originally but Luke was nice enough to tell me so when I told Mary what logan said I left him out of it.  And so then somehow we got to talking about Mary and how she's married to ""Joseph...""  it was really a szhamma of a time."	m
"Today a manlady, (gender unrecognizable), was stopped in front of me at Washington  Lincoln. If you have ever been to this intersection - you KNOW that it's always tied in knots. It's one of the gateways to Venice Beach, so its certain that there will be mass amounts of lost tourists, hippies and locals trying get get places. ANyway, the Manlady slowly rolled backwards and hit my bumper. S/he got stuck under my truck. I had to back up to unleash her! I couldn't care less. We passed through the intersection and s/he merged into the turning lane. Heading right to COSTCO to buy the extra double sized portions that suited her extra doubled-sized self.  I waved, ""Don't worry about it"".  S/he obviously had enough, and beyond, to deal with in her mega-shopping store life."	f

I'm awake, just can't sleep a wink.  I'm pregnant AGAIN.  Yes, that was a scream.  It's kind of cool in a way, and kind of crazy-making in a way.  How could my life get any more out of control?   I was already sliding toward a breakdown, and then this happens, out of the blue, without my knowledge or approbation.  Do some bodies just want to get pregnant?  Must be.  Do some babies just want to be born?  I dunno.  That's the Mormon way of looking at it, and it's a very comforting thought, tho the cynic in me ( a big part of me) says come ON now with the Mormon folklore.  But what else makes more sense?  Not much.  Sorry to go nuts with the rhetorical questions.  In case you're wondering, being pregnant is no picnic.  Here's the rigamarole on pregnancy #FIVE:  1)  Very nauseated.  Midwives say to take vitamin B6, unisom, and frequent small high protein snacks. 2) That doesn't work.  Begin vomiting.  Can't eat anything.  Midwives call in prescription for phenegren to Seattle while I'm on vacation (vomiting and lying on the couch in Seattle instead of Utah. ) 3)  I want to die now. 4)  Stop taking phenegren pills because I can't keep them down.  Try phenegren suppositories.  5)Phenegren suppositories give diarrhea.  Stop taking. 6)  Can't eat or keep down any food for 24.  Go to ER for IV hydration and nausea drugs.  AAAAAHHHH. 7)  ER doc gives prescription for zofran.  Ten pills cost 100 bucks--that's my COPAY.  AAAAAHHH.  The day after the IV and the zofran is heaven. 8)  But the nausea comes back.  But not all the way, as long as I take the zofran religiously every eight hours. 9)  Two pills left.  My insurance hasn't approved more zofran.  It's early sunday morning. I need three pills to get to Monday.  I'm scared.  And who will pay for more pills, Christian asks. 10)  We can sell our house and move into a tent to pay for more pills.  I don't care.  I'll kill myself.  I'm a wimp.  I can't take it anymore.  I feel worn to a nub, and less strong and resiliant than ever before in my life.  Shouldn't I be all strong and tough after what I've been thru? 11) The zofran makes you constipated and hemerrhoidal.  Buy stool softener and witch hazel wipes.  Dignity is gone. 12)  They can send a man to the moon,  or send a man's penis skyrocketing anyway, but what about helping a girl out with her pregnancy.  Surely more women experience pregnancy than men experience erectile dysfunction.  And surely the relative magnitude of the two problems is not lost on anybody?  13) Do people know what it's like to feel like you have the flu for three, four, five, six, seven, eight or even nine months?  OK--I don't mean to be ungrateful.  I know a lot of woment would love to be pregnant and aren't/can't, etc.  I love my babies, that's for sure.  But I'm suffering big time right now, in my own private Idaho.	f
"Let's start with the good.   My favorite pirate has a  urlLink blog .  Great story about said pirate: Once, while walking along the banks of the Mississippi about this time of year - Winter Musical time, probably  Annie Get Your Gun  - she stepped on a corn cob and yelled, ""OHMYGOD it's a BIIIIRRRRD!""   The not so good.   Justin and I had a rough weekend.  I will never ever ever look at eight apartments in two days ever again.  EVER.  I will especially never spend all of Valentine's Day driving around Kansas City, including the lovely Troost area and other parts of Missouri I will never be able to find again.  But he found an apartment at 4:00 yesterday afternoon, a really nice one for not a lot of money, and it's close to my apartment (which was actually quite surprising).  I must add that it was also not on our list to visit - we just drove past and decided to go in.  I also had to watch  Swimming Pool , which was the most confusing movie ever, even if I didn't sleep through half of it.  What the hell happened?  If you can tell me why the girl at the end was different than the girl during the rest of the movie, I will give you $5.00.   But Friday was great.   We went to a terrible dinner at the Elephant Bar - don't ever go there - came home and played with Roo, who is enamored with Justin (who isn't?) and then went to Boozefish with the girls.  Connie was such a doll and brought us flowers and Sara's cat, Bill Murray, tried to eat them.   A yarn tragedy  occurred Saturday morning.  I saw  urlLink this  yarn online at work and I thought I might like to have it, mostly because it was super chunky and I love anything chunky and also because it was on sale for $3.99 when it's usually $15.95.  That's a 75% discount, people.  I could make a really inexpensive sweater out of that.  I thought I remembered how I linked to the page.  Two hours on the computer later, I still couldn't find it.  I gave up.  So I come into work today, hoping there's still some left (I bookmarked the page, of course) and there's not.  The yarn of the week is pretty cool, but I would probably need a lot more than I should spend.  KNITPICKS, Kristin, KNITPICKS.  If you ever forget the name of the site again, I will kill you.  I am still very angry.   I miss  Abby, Kate, Maria, Clark, Dave, Big Mar and Chuck B. and most of all, my Peep.  I will hopefully get to see her this weekend.

I've found a new Blog that i really enjoy reading.   urlLink Father Jake .  He is a self-confessed eccentric and sometimes heretical Anglican priest... but I love the stuff he is saying.   I think this may be appealing to the hunger for discipline that's growing in me.  He had a really good post  urlLink yesterday  about Grace.  He writes: When my youngest son was born, the nurse gave him to me to hold. I walked over to a corner of the room away from the bright lights, and rocked him in my arms as I whispered words of joy. He shook his tiny head, and struggled to open his eyes. We gazed into one another. Time stopped. Nothing but the flow of love between us existed. A moment of grace. A moment that seemed so natural, so spontaneous, and in some ways, so familiar. I had been to that place before. But I couldn't remember when, or where.  As the years went by, the grace flowed. As love was given, it was now returned; not because I was such a perfect father, or the most handsome, or the smartest; but because I was Dad.   This is the root of my understanding of our relationship with God. God is madly, head-over-heals in love with us, and woos us, and all of creation, into being, because we are. I have a hard time holding on to this foundational relationship. In day to day life, it doesn't fit very well. Head over there and read his discussion... I promise, it will make you re-evaluate grace.    Grace   She carries a pearl In perfect condition What once was hers What once was friction What left a mark No longer stains  Because grace makes beauty Out of ugly things  Grace finds beauty In everything  Grace finds goodness In everything   -U2	m

I`m trying as best I can to focus on the positive, but what my head tries to focus on is overuled by what my gut instincts tell me.  I was at the doctors the other day, and he`s doing the best he can to try and reassure me that all is going well, all will get better and that things are not all bad. My head was going yes, I have a job to go back to, I have a lovely supportive wife, and professional help. My gut instinct however was telling me thats`s it! The only thing I really have going is my marriage, and if I don`t get my head together soon then I`m going to tear that apart along with everything else in my life.  From my own life experience I almost feel as if I`m being rebuilt so I can be torn down again. I don`t want to, and don`t feel capable of returning to my job. It`s not an environment in which my self-esteem is going to thrive. If I go back, I give it a fornight before I`m a basket case again. I have no true supports other than my wife and my doctor.  It`s been a lifetime of letdowns, frustration, futlity, boredom, dissapointment, shame and uselesness. I have no ideal skills at all. I`m purely floating, helpless as I become ever more unravelled.   All the time I feel sick with nerves. The aches, sleeplessness, anxiety and sheer terror of what is next fester in my guts. I need more out of life than being ignored, bullied, ridiculed, excluded. I need somewhere I belong. I need to feel I am valuable and appreciated, not merely conveniant and tolerated.  I have lost all joy  all hope. Whats next? Fucked if I know.	m

One of my very favorite contemporary Classical music composers,  urlLink John Corigliano  has released a new Concerto, according to  urlLink this interview from The Associated Press .   The reason why I like Corigliano so much is probably because he's one of the few composers I've actually met, in addition to   urlLink Lukas Foss  and  urlLink Pauline Oliveros .  While still at  urlLink B-W  I was fortunate to meet Foss and Corigliano during  urlLink FOCUS Festival  events.  I attended a Masterclass given by Oliveros during my senior year, and since there were, maybe, 10 of us in the class, there was a lot of one-on-one time with the composer herself.  Anyway, Corigliano, in my opinion, has an impressive oevre, from song cycles (with text by Dylan Thomas...yum!), to concerti, to symphonies, to film scores, including  urlLink The Red Violin , which I love.	f

AND THEN theres leo leaving for college. i cried. literally. i didnt tell him why though. but i couldnt help it. i think im just sad bc i feel like hes going sumwhere ..which he is..in his life. and hes gona leave me behind..which he is.  like i duno how to react...i know i should be happy for him. but then i hate the fact i wont be seeing him taht often. which sucks. like i knew hed be leaving high school and going to college. but the last couple days it finally sunk in. hes gona be leaving me really soon. in like 2 months. i hate thinking about that. but its the fact. i have to.   thats the thing. i think the reason why i mature faster than my cousins or sum of my friends is bc ive been though stuff that they have to idea. like having sumone you care about very very much leave you. or being held up at gun point. or having your dad call you a problem child and wanting to push you out a window. or even having thier best friend talk shit about them. and then tell the whole school. giving you the worst name you could possibly think. at least for a girl. or being used by ppl just for their own pleasure. ive actually met guys who want head..if they dont get it..they wont talk to you again.   is it just me or is every good day followed by a bad day? like my last entry talked abou the best day ever. seriously it was. but now i feel ....weird. i duno what i feel. but im starting to think its true. maybe theres a balance...good and bad...hmm. it does make sense..or at least to me it does. but all the good days and good ppl you meet(ricky) make the bad days worth it.   oh well. Leo called me and said were gona spend the whole tomoro together. were gona talk. i love this man. i hate to see him down. and hes down when im down. so i guess i should work though this for him. and myself. no one wants to feel bad. i dont want anyone to feel bad. i told him not to worry. but he said he cant help it. he likes me a lot. he says. i trust him. but why is it so hard to tell him im gona miss him? maybe im not ready to let him go.	f

"Doj has been acting weird lately. Weird, in the sense that she's been keeping mostly to herself, not talking--at least not as much as she used to--to everyone, particularly me. She has almost ignored me in the past four days and I don't know why she's being almost indifferent. I know that she keeps quiet when someone says or does something she doesn't like, but hell, I don't know what I did to deserve the silent treatment.   The other girls are teasing her about her ""secret"" bf. I don't know if there is such or if there's any budding lovelife and I don't care either. If she's got one, then I should be happy for her and I really would be if she would just sort herself out. It makes me so uneasy being around her."	f
The movie....for all those that didn't go...wasn't too bad. Infact, yesterday was pretty good all together. I was supposed to go to the pool with nicole but we were too lazy to go anywhere till like 3 or sumthing when our moms + Christina picked us both up to go to the mall. We ate lunch at Ruby Tuesdays (slight mmmm)but I wasn't that hungry. I haven't been very hungry lately. I keep feeling really down about myself...its really irritating. We hung out around the mall for a while. I got a new bathing suit and sum church clothes, including a matching outfet to Nicole.   Then idk...they drove us over to Matt and Juliets where we had dinner. It was cool, their house is REALLY nice and so is their pond....great for spontaniously(sp) jumping into..pretty sick stuff...but it was worth it cuz matt paid for my movie ticket and gave me 7 bucks for snack foods.   Then we got to the movie juss on friggin time...good movie i gotta say. The first one is always better and stuff but this one was different. It had more laughs...yet more drama....the whole thing was pretty much drama....infact most of it juss made u wanna feel sorry for the guy...perhaps thats y i feel so weird today....naah...  Have a nice day everybody...especially u so and so.	f
"Wow...I don't know what is wrong with me today...but..I feel like writing.....even though I have nuthing to write about that I know of. Hmmmm......today I went down to Ervin's to get my PS2 back, and I hung around there for a while...then he got a call from McDonalds....he had to work today....*and we were in the middle of 5th Element too*  So he got dressed really fast...and then I drove him to McD's and then I went to EconoFoods to get the root beer like my dad told me to..and I saw Naomi there...that was pretty kool.  *hehehe..her name backwards is Imoan......gehehehehehe*  So, I went and got the root beer and got to about the hospital when i realized, I left my PS2 at Ervin's....WOW...I'm stupid....so..I did a quick U-ey in the road and headed back for Ervin's. When i got there his mom had left the door unlocked, because she noticed that I left it there, and knew I would be coming back for it.  So when I did, she kinda laughed at me, and then told me to lock the door when I left, and I did.  I then left and drove back to my house, and played a little bit of DDR, I did the lessons, seeing if by doing them all I could get another song or sumthin', but it got really boring, so I quit.  Then I sat down and typed on the computer for while...waiting for people to come on...so I can talk to them....and when people did finally come on..I had to go eat dinner.....boy it was good.  Coloflower*can't spell*and cheese, with chicken.....yum...it was good....I can still taste the cheese and Coloflower*partially because it's probably still stuck in my braces*  Dang you braces....oh well.....I get them off soon...YAY!!  My next appointment is on the 4th of April or sumthin'....YAY!  I don't get them off then though.....poo.... I GO TO JAPAN IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!!  I hope you all miss me when I'm gone...or I'll be uber pissed..and if you want me to get yo anything...tell me....or....nuthing for you!  :-P hm...what else is there to talk about???? hm......I feel there is sumthing else I need to say...but I don't know what it is....... Well..I've been writing for basically a half hour now...and...I've kinda run out of stuff to say...even though I know there is sumthing I'm forgetting...what could it be.....I DON'T KNOW!!!  Well.....I figured out one thing after sitting here looking at the monitor for like 15 minutes....I STILL MISS TINA!!!  I don't kare how much people tell me to get over her...or how much I tell myself that I am over her.....I'm just lying to myself....I really miss her...even if she does hate me...or....if she's actually reading this......put ""you"" in for ""her"" and ""she""...and change ""does"" to ""do"" Man I'm pathetic...why is it so hard to get over Tina?!?!?!?!  Sumone give me an answer or a hammer or sumthin'....PLEEZE!!!  Well...I don't know what the other thing was stil.....but..I'm gonna go back to my still empty life.....Peace  Spense  ***EDIT***  I had to edit it....because the time was horribly wrong...it's actually 8:30ish when I wrote this...not the time that it said before...which was like 5:30ish...stupid wrong timey thingy..  Either way...back on to the topic I was just talking about before I go to bed...I don't like being called awesome.....pleeze...no one call me awesome.....this period of time has caused me to understand that awesome can turn into utter hatred really fast...Why did it have to change so fast?  How do feelings flip back and forth that fast?!?!?  confusing.....I THINK SO!!!  I don't think that you can really hate sumone until you get to know them fully...and I don't think that I was given enough time to fully express myself...no I'm not trying to bash anyone....I'm just saying sumthin' that I feel...and if anyone takes this to heart and changes their outlook on sumone...THEN I WILL HUNT THE DOWN AND KILL THEM!!!! K?!?!?  good.  Peace Again  Spense"	m

So, I've been gone for a little while. I actually had to work  at  work. I actually clocked 15 hours in my timesheet Wednesday alone (yes, I'm on salary, but I still have to fill out a timesheet) and I think there's a chance I actually  understated  my hours. In the mean time, I picked up some odd jobs around the office and ended up with a pretty decent promotion - so I guess that explains that.      To my loyal (read: occasional, if there's nothing better to do), I'm sorry. I just felt all this pressure to write something interesting, while over on  urlLink Godzilla vs. Peachfuzzerila  my boy  urlLink Marky Mark  is pontificating on some really interesting stuff.   I guess this is turning into an apology and a promise. I'll have some really interesting stuff to say in the future, I promise. And I'm sorry I haven't been more attentive. All I ask in return is that you help finish the script by Effin Sweet. Please. Besides proposing to my wife, it may have been the best idea I've ever come up with - and if you know my wife and me, you'll know that's the truth. And now, for something completely different.	f

I finally came across the newest thing in breath mints today: the gelatinous little  urlLink Momints . And after all the   urlLink Momints hype  in glossy magazines like  InStyle , I found them in a 7-11. [note to 7-11: please re-think the banana slurpees, blech.] Please don't ask me why, but I'd actually wondered after seeing pictures, if these mints were like little tiny hard candies or something that you chewed or maybe even swallowed. The answer? Neither! They are like those bath oil beads that instantly dissolve in hot water and start gushing out artificial rose-scented grease, only the mints contain a tasty/nasty (75% tasty) liquid like the kind inside of Freshen Up gum. They're not as strong as Altoids or those lethal Listerine breath strips, but instead leave a Lifesaver level of mint taste in your mouth.  The most fun part, though, is when the liquid is gone and you just have the bits of gelatin stuck to your tongue. It's just like when you were little and eating  urlLink Botan Rice Candy , with the rice paper covering that seemed for all the world like something inedible until it started to dissolve in your mouth. I suppose inedible things could also dissolve (like Lemon Pledge maybe), but Botan really is just rice, you can eat it, it's true. At least that's what my sister told me. It's also possible that this is not universally nostalgia-inducing and you may find it a little gross but just wait 15 seconds, and the mo-mint will be over.	f
like i said in my last blog.. it's all about national service. does everyone in life go through depression? i know i do. and here i am feeling that same shitty feeling even though nothing bad happened to me or to the ppl around me. i read that depression is a disease and it can be treated. maybe my cure is to escape the clutches and chains of the government and be free. i heard sfb is going to sponsor half of the budget if any foreign director came to singapore to shoot. but they won't support any local filmaker. i heard they want to turn this country into an art city and sport city but again they won't support it. strict censorship. how to be artistic? strict education. how to be champions in sports? the singapore pledge has the word equality mentioned. how can i sign for the saf if they show no justice and equality? navy - muslims are out of bounds. air force - no muslim fighter pilots. army - none in combat engineer, or scouts or commandos(maybe one or two). are we not good enough? reason they give - our neighbourong countries are muslim countries. so does that mean when there's any war against these countries, we won't fight for singapore?   how can i love a country which won't trust it's own citizens?	m
I was just wondering....  WHO GETS MARRIED ON A WEDNESDAY!  and then expects others to drop everything to not only go to the wedding but then to a reception wed. night?!  Does this seem fair to the friends and family of the two people getting married?   To  answer my question...my brother gets married on a wednesday.....and so both Brad and I have to take most of the day if not all of that day off so we can go.........kinda lame!!!! oh well at least he is getting married, it could be worse he could end up one of those old bachalor brothers thats lives alone forver and never has kids or a girlfriend or anything.  Although if he did stay single he would have more money to lend me, and this would deffinatly be a good thing..... dang! but his bride to be is way cool! and he's happy so I guess wednesday it is, but really I want feed back on this.   What do all you people out there think about wednesday weddings?  -B	f

"Calm.....cool.....time to stir minds   How many of you are fully commited in a relationship right now? How many people can wake up and say "" wow, somebody loves me""?. Well, here  is something to make some people think and maybe evenchange just a little.  Normally, I would write every detailed nook and cranny "" about why I am feeling this way. Since I have sooooooo much repect for some things, I will remain silent. Yet, I will pose some hypothetical's for you.  I have been in many relationships and the majority of them have gone south. I don't mean an excellent fun filled vacation neither. I mean straight to the brimstone depths of hell. Realtionships have proved difficult and maybe almost impossible for me. It has come to this point, within a year or two when I do decide to date or whatever, I will give a fair warning, I am not good at relationships. I tend to get scared several months into them and run like a coward with a yellow stripe down my back. Funny thing is, I have alawys maintained an excellent friendship and course of cordialty with the majority of my ex's. Some have even become my best friends of sorts. Except for that mentally challenged fool ecuadorian kettle of confused emotions that I actually cut off recently.   Why can't some people be friends after the breakup??? I pose this question to female and males alike?? I have no qualms nor dissention after a relationship to put everything behind me. Some people find that too hard. Some people think that is not fair. Some think that it is selfish.  THe most hurtful words that anyone ever told me when I was breaking up with them were "" if we are not together, then what do you want me around for ?""   I couldn't answer then  I could answer now. When you have family you have support. When you have friends, you have a group that will push you. When you have someone that has the potential of becoming your shoulder, your ear, your life. That is more important then anything else that I could see. Thing is, how can you not be with someone you were with and have them be so important in your life? I don't know, if you have the answer, let me know.  My life is very complicated right now and the only reason why it is like this is because I made it so.  I have made sacrifices in the name of "" search "". I hope that my search this time will be a right one. If I fucked up, I wouldn't give much a chance after it.  Well, short blog,   Peace, Love,  Take care   Fish  >)))"">"	m

"Weekend   On Friday night my grandma passed away.   On Saturday I visited my auntie (and alsochecked in with the family members who are taking care of her) and she looks even worse. She could barely talk to us because she was in so much pain from the cancer. She has a morphine patch that supposedly provides relief, but she was teary-eyed and her face was in a constant grimace. She tried to say hello to us, but then another surge of pain would shoot through her and she would hold her stomach and squeeze her eyes shut. This is from a woman who never complains about anything. I sometimes have to leave the room because I feel so helpless and sad and frustrated that I can'tlessen her pain. I know the magnitude of it must beexcruciating when she whispers, ""It hurts.""   After that my brother, his gf, and I drove up to visit my dad. On the way there my brother goes, ""It's bright!"" and reaches for his sunglasses. And I just about choked on my own spit because he puts on his face these monstrously huge, hideous, Yoko-Ono-type, my-pupils-are-dilated-so-I-have-to-wear-these-sunglasses sunglasses. And he puts them on OVER his regular glasses. I laughed so hard. ""Where did you get those?!!"" I said and he replied, ""Walgreens. 5 bucks!"" and I said, ""God, I can't believe you were making fun of ME with MY sunglasses; just look at YOU with YOUR sunglasses on!"" He stated in non-response, ""I wear them to play poker.""   Me: What??? Why??  Him: So people can't see my reaction. And so I can look at people and they can't tell.  Me: I can't believe you wear those. Isn't poker a coool game? Don't you want to  look  cool?  Him: No. I just want to win money.   Together we visited my dad who looks worse. His mouth was frightening to look into. His tongue was dried out and layers of skin were peeling off in rows. His entire mouth on the inside was peeling and it was like peering into the mouth of death. It was a cave of dried skin cobwebs instead of a regular mouth--an openingthat is normally lubricated and alive. It was wrong and horrible. I wanted to help him. I wanted to take a spray bottle and mist his mouth with a couple squirts. I wanted him to respond when I talked to him or when the doctor shook his shoulder to try to rouse him, but nothing. The doctor told us he was still unresponsive and that he had kidney failure, a lung infection, and a urine infection. He said he would be able to tell us more on Sunday.   Sunday morning I got a call from my mom. There's no hope for my dad and we all decided together as a family that we could not prolong his life in the state that he was in. He's unresponsive, emaciated, doesn't talk, and cannot eat. We didn't want to prolong his state, connected to IVs and catheters, with a feeding tube. The doctors assured us that he would be comfortable and ensured us that they'd do their best to minimize any pain. My mom said that it was the right thing to do because he shouldn't suffer anymore. I told her that I agreed.   My mom said to me, ""It's so sad that all these bad things are happening all at once,  con ."" Then she corrected herself, ""Well, not BAD; that's just life,  con ... It's just life."""	f

Just got back from Wal-Mart. Fun trip. I got a new shirt and some socks out of it, so I'm not complaining. I'm hoping I get paid tonight so that I can buy Crys something for her Votech graduation tonight. The G man is supposed to go too, but I guess he just decided not to. One load today that I know of at work. I have to go at 4:00. I think Manz and I can handle it alone, but some help definitely wouldn't hurt. I think today is going to be my last day there, but I'm not sure yet. My mom said it was, but who knows. I've decided that I'm going to go with Springer for my next rant. Well, I'm going to go now, I'll write again maybe when I get out of work, and if not then, then after Crystal's graduation thing. I get to go up to Fonda to see it. Yay! I don't know what my fascination with that school is, but the memories, both good and bad, all hit me at once when I go there. Anyway, goodbye for now.

I think I found a place to live! It is really nice and very cute! And its in the locality that I want to live in. Its close to work, pubs, clubs, restaurants, and shops! And its cheap! Around $330/month for a 1300 sq. ft. two bedroom apt. The interior is so beautiful. Think of Portland style of 20s architecture with a hint of British influence. I am very excited to have seen it. I was told that I should negotiate the rent even lower...like around Rs. 12,000, which comes out to $266/month. So, okay I will try...doesn't hurt to ask right? That's how I got here!!!!   Yes, India is very cheap but like the States â there are certain things that are cheap or expensive. Today, I was looking at liquor like vodka, more specifically Vanilla Stoli (forgot the name brand) but it would normally cost $20 in the states, here it costs $6. Cable television here is around $2-$4/month. I bought lunch at the Intel cafeteria on Monday for $0.90 (and yes it was a meal!). A pair of nice jeans here cost $10âŚclothes are also cheap and the quality is amazing!!!   I still can't get over the MNC's (multi-national companies) buildings here...its very western architecture mixed right in with shanty towns or old, dilapidated looking buildings. I just saw Dell yesterday and today I saw HP. VERY WEIRD. Its all here in India! There are also tons of people hereâŚ.close to 7 million.   I have impressed quite a few Indians here with my knowledge of Bangalore - research helped. Impressed that I know the street names and even some landmarks - and also a few of the major stores here. After 6 days just being here, I am starting to feel comfortable and at home. That just amazes me...and I am even starting to do the Indian head nod from left to right. Next thing I'll be picking up some salwar kameezes to wear.	f
Today is such an awesome day!  I feel good, I look good (my humble opinion...), it's just a beautiful day!  My vertigo is getting much better now - Thank God.  That was driving me nuts.  I didn't have any of it yesterday, and so far none today.  :)  What a nice day.  And here I am, chained to my desk with all of this paperwork...ugh.  That's OK - I feel so good, I will just rip through all of this paperwork this morning and maybe I can get out of here a bit early this afternoon.  That's a plan.  We'll see.  I think I may try to have a nooner with my hubby too - that is one of the perks about working with him!  And to all of my family, that really didn't want to hear about that - Sorry!  But isn't it good to know that your daughter, sister, neice, cousin does have a really EXCELLENT sex life?  That is important! haha!  :) wink, wink!  I know, I'm incorrigible - but you know me, I've always been that way!  That's how I landed me that husband in the first place!  Anyway - hope everyone else is having as good a day as I am!  Talk to y'all later!	f
"I am glad I got that figured out...my mum was all freaking out about the aprons and junk so I called Beka and she was like ""Don't worry about it! I will bring you one!"" How exciting.

"ASSET RESPOSITORY    What is an asset repository?  You mean you don’t know?  Well, here’s the beef.  An asset repository is similar to a bank depository—it stores valuables, although in the case of asset repository, it stores valuable information.  These repositories are high class, elaborate, and require the same thing that banks do—lots and lots of money.  Read more about asset repositories in the following extended definition.     “An asset is only an asset when you can find it,  or you know that you have it in the first place”   Teri Ross, Techexchange.com    An asset repository is rather a combination two elements: digital asset management and asset repository.  Whereas the digital asset management (DAM) is a tool to organize digital media assets for storage and retrieval, an asset repository is where and how the data is stored, typically on “a high-end UNIX server, [with] large online storage space and high-speed networks” (Ross).  The DAM application organizes and retrieves the digital media and the asset repository stores it.    Digital Asset Management   Digital Asset Management (DAM) is a means to keep, find and secure files of text, images or sound.  DAM also tracks ownership and rights of the content and implements task management.  Well organized and accessible content results in the ability to quickly find images and data, which systemizes workflow, saving time and money (Brown).   In the computer world . . . there are systems that will pick up after us and remember where we put things. These systems will retrieve items, let us pass them around, and then clean the place up when we're through. I refer, of course, to the software and hardware systems that are called, variously, digital media management, media asset management or digital asset management (DAM) (Smith).  Digital asset management is the software and hardware needed for content management.  The location in which content is stored is the asset repository.   Asset (or Content) Repository  Actual “asset repositories” are generally found in large, high-end asset management systems ($100,000 and up).  Asset repositories are a “secure collection of the source files themselves”.  The image at the webpage below shows the asset repository as a sort of holding tank for content.   urlLink http://www.assetnow.com/index.cfm/4,437,html   A large asset repository performs like a database.  It contains: security, replication, backup safeguards, disaster recovery, referential integrity, centralized data management and a hierarchical storage structure. “Such a system lends itself to workflows that require access security, including management of rights or permissions and access for suppliers or customers. These systems require a high-performance server, a fast network and significant online storage capacity” (Brown).  Asset repositories are sophisticated and expensive systems that contain the actual content within a secure database.  This usually means higher performance software like , “high-end UNIX servers, formidable online storage, and very high-speed networks”.  This allows for “security levels, replication, referential integrity, and centralized data management. Also included is the comfort of full hierarchical storage management and disaster recovery” (Ross).     Solutions based on the asset repository model are ideal when systematizing studios with industrial workflow, managing rights and permissions (such as the intellectual property of either your company or a third party), and structuring global access by employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and customers (Smith).   Media Catalog vs. Asset Repository  Instead of an asset repository, smaller companies often use media catalogs “that store proxies alone, indexed to the source files"" (Brown).  Media catalogs have proxies (like thumbnails) which are stored in a database indexed by keywords.  The actual source files are under the control of the operating system and are not touched.  Media catalogs are low cost, easy to install and administer and have “scalability across multiple divisions of an enterprise” (Ross).  Media catalogs don’t manage the actual content, so anyone with system access to view, change, move or delete content elements (Ross).     Media Catalog  Entry level solution Desktop or within a workgroup Organizes small collections of images, graphics and text Provides multiple access Cost – under $50,000   Asset Repository  Mid-range solution Client/server technology Wide area networks Manages all assets used in a production job (layouts, images, fonts) Files stored on server, access via DAM system only Check-in/check-out to control versions Stores assets with links for simple retrieval Cost – under $100,00   Upper-End Solutions 3-tier client/server architecture Designed to “drive enterprise on the Internet” Cost – over $100,00 (Smith)"	f

"Auto Response from Garaputo316: I am outside standing in the rain, legs spread wide with my arms stretched towards the sky. My hands are tightly gripping a mighty sword as I scream ""I have the powwwweeeerrrr!!!!"" You see, I am attempting to get struck by lightning so that it will seem as if I am the great He-Man. Even if it only lasts for a split second, it will be crazy as hell.  That's what my away message said for a little while today. You guys thought I was joking, I was serious. Except I had a pole and not a sword... but who the heck has a sword nowadays **coughJustincough**. I'm on some He-Man kick after watching  Masters of the Universe . The movie wasn't cool or anything, but when Dolph Lundgren yelled ""I have the power!"" I remembered the part from the old show where he would lift his sword in the air and lightning would strike it. Then I remembered when Charlie Wagner imitated it with a metal baseball bat and I laughed for a half hour straight. It was pretty crazy when I did it, but I had no luck with the lightning strike, sadly.  After that little endeavor I walked up to 7-11 to buy some Sour Bright Crawlers. I ended up staying there for a while reading an  Import Tuner  magazine. When I left the guy made fun of me for staying in there too long. I just laughed. It could've been worse; I could've stayed in there much longer, but I decided to leave before I seemed like a kook. Apparently I already looked like one. It's ok though, next time I will stay in there  all  day reading  all  the magazines and eating  all  the food -- and I won't pay for it. Wuahaha. Yep, I'm wiggin.  My dad said that we're going to work at 3 o clock this morning and I was like ""AM?"" and he's like ""yeah."" The funny thing is he's not playing around. That's how we do it around here yo.

My prediction.   An email I sent out 2 minutes ago.  I predict that Rick Fox and Bryan Russel will drop a combined 40 on the Pistons tonight, Shaq will make 14 straight free-throws, Payton will lead the team in rebounds, and Kobe will have 4 points, 20 assists, and no turnover.  Karl will lose his knee brace and his right shoe on a lay-up attempt, which will hit Rasheed in the eye and sideline him for the entire game.  Hamilton's mask will fog up and his blurred vision will cause him to run into a pick and breaking his nose in the 3rd quarter.    Kid Rock will spill his beer and Chauncey will trip on it, breaking his tailbone.  Luke Walton will dunk on Ben Wallace, and as a result both Walton senior and Phil Jackson will have to be escorted out by security for excessive celebration and excessive reference to John Wooden, respectively.  And in the end, they will probably still lose to the Pistons.  Which is just as well, I would never share a championship with all these fair weather band wagon fans in LA anyway.  Fuck them.  Tell them that Yankees still have a shot and their hats are on sale.  After watching all the Lakers' pre, regular, and post season games, I knew from the beginning that this was going to be a tough series, despite all these basketball gurus annointing Lakers in 5.  Somehow, recognizing all the flaw in my team makes me feel like the one true Lakers' fan in the world.  cho	m

"Whats new in the land of the Suddenly single? Well, how about a review of the best places to goggle the other supposedly singles, suddenly singles and permanently singles, and see if we can tell the difference between them. Our favorite places are in the La Jolla/Del Mar area, but there are lots more yet to discover, say Downtown San Diego, and Mission Valley.   Cafe Japengos - known for its BUSTling Thursday nights, this crowd is a little more relaxed these days. Here you will see mostly blonde and gray hair - blonde women and gray-haired men chasing them! You can get the best sushi in san diego here as well as the best apple martini. All this after working out at the club/spa sporting club one across the circle.   Epazotes/Cafe Pacifica - Del mar is not only famous for its horses, but its long-legged FILLIES!!! Here you get a much mellower scene, where you can start at Epazotes, stroll across to Cafe Pacifica, then wine-down at the wine bar at Il Forniao. This is my personal favorite, but watch out - here is where you are most likely to be taken in by a beautiful sunset and romanced into thinking a permanently single is just a regular old single (You see there are differences). Here you will be lulled by the sound of the fountian tinkling as you sip a special port or smoke a special cigar. Dont fall asleep, or like a midsummers night dream, you will wake up to find yourself with bruises and not know where they came from!   what else? There is Dobsons Downtown, where I hear the lawyers lurk, and then Gordon Beirsh, the younger business/networking crowd.   This suddenly single has decided that she will not be going to these places anymore, due to an unfortunate incident involving too much, too soon, and not enough from the wrong person! You figure that one out and you win the ""suddenly single sweepstakes"". :)  When suddenly single, it is generally a good idea to call all the people that you forgot about while not single, and re-connect, apologising and supplicating yourself until it becomes embarrassing for said friends. They will forgive you, but you must try harder next time you are not single to maintain contact or they may forget about you.  Places to take those that you are kissing up to: Art - The Vatican is coming out of the closet - er - showing itself - er - displaying its treasures (oh! I give UP) at the San Diego Museum of art, in a rare never before seen in public appearance. music - the yeah yeah yeahs are playing at Soma, soon. Very high cool factor. duh. For the rest of you yahoos, Friday is the ""your 5"" concert with Jessica simpson and a bunch of un-altered MUSICIANS. Sports - The rock and roll marathon is coming up - running, drinking and bands - a great event to spend all our suddenly single time preparing for!   When suddenly single, I found that the best therapy was window-shopping for things that any of your exes would not have approved of - open-toed shoes, low-rise jeans, new peircings- this time in your tongue.   Keep to your friends, friends, and you'll never go wrong."	f

It seems to be a day for unofficial 'chainblogging'.  Other people's thoughts brushing against my own and opening memories, ideas, new paths for me to explore.   I enjoy reading  urlLink Ronni's  blog. She writes with such a calm, authoritative style. I admire her clarity of thought and 'togetherness'. She comes across as a woman who knows who she is and what she wants out of life.   Today she posted the second part of  urlLink 'A mother's final, best lesson ' (you can find the first part  urlLink here ).Beautifully written as always, evocative and touching, I could almost see Ronni's mother in my minds eye.   My mother also died of cancer. My memories similar and yet so very different. When she told me she was dying I poured my feelings onto paper. I never showed her what I had written. After her death I shared my words with my sister who asked me to read them at mum's funeral. One of the most difficult things I had ever done.   I have posted the piece on  urlLink Diet_Coke .	f
well, hooray: my mother offered to pay me ten dollars if i can remove these weird advertisements that appear every so often on her dell  urlLink peecee . i tried  urlLink ad-aware , which was certainly impressive in removing fifty to sixty files i can care less about but it did nothing to remove those pop up things. i might give $1 to nigel because he suggested trying everything  urlLink here ; surely something will work. we'll see about that.   the most worrying thing, i suppose, is that altogether this impressive set up has found six tracking devices, and i am sure there are at least six more hidden somewhere inside. which is typical of the reliability that we have come to expect of windows, i must say. thankfully i have patient parents.   well, on to more important things: a woman who once had an american accent  urlLink now speaks cockney , which is bad news because we in asia have only just started to graduate to a half-hearted american accent.   a pack of ciggies sold in france used to cost about SG$7.91 on average, now they cost about SG$9.33. who says our fags are expensive? (they cost SG$6.20 on average, see  urlLink this , and 44.7% of this six bucks goes into taxes, none of which is used to promote an anti-tobacco lifestyle)  and the rio karma looks like a very very nice (albeit looking cheaply engineered)  urlLink audio player .  pitchfork's  urlLink 100 top albums of the 90s . sonic youth's goo is at 80-something... and stereolab is ten places behind... and also on fifty-one. and when they release the top 20 tomorrow, i'll literally bet that two of radiohead's albums will make it... into the top five. where's jim o'rourke (my prediction: 15) and christian fennesz (10) and gastr del sol (5? please?) and godspeed (15)? even boc had one entry. mmm, anticipation. i have to go make coffee. bye.	m

"I work in the seemingly glamorous (but not always) field of public relations. Sometimes you get really great clients, sometimes you get some real nut jobs; sometimes your clients love you and sometimes they hate you.At the end of the day, I wouldn't switch jobs for anything.   Anyway, I am working for a client who loves us and they actually do good things--it's an organization involved in increasing awareness about organ donation.   Now organ donation wasn't something I had ever really thought about. I always thought it would be a ""nice to do when I die"" kind of thing, but was never motivated to actually sign the back of my drivers license.   Boy have I changed my mind. Last week I was at a client event where I had the chance to meet both donor families and transplant recipients. These are among the most remarkable people I have ever met.   First the donor families--for some it's been a while since they received that phone call and rushed to the hospital to be by the bedside of a family member that was essentially dead. For some that phone call was more fresh in their memories. But, for all of them, being able to donate their relative's organs and tissues was a powerful act, often made under very difficult circumstances. Without fail, every single donor family said the decision was easy and has helped them heal.   The recipients--what a group. They're so full of life and energy. They're also tremendously grateful for the second chance they have been given. And they're going on to accomplish great things. Many were at one point in danger of dying, but then that phone call came and they got a new lease on life.   As I said, I am a changed person because of these people I was lucky to have met. The back of my license is signed and I am planning to talk with my family about my wishes. I've always been willing to help people wherever I can. I just want to make sure that I will be able to do so even when I am gone."	f
"Last night I enabled the ""comments"" feature on my blog because I learned that it existed.     Sedaris   I took the car for its maiden voyage tonight, to see David Sedaris at the Border's in Buckhead.  My friend Kathy from Athens went with me, and we met Lachele and Alan and Helly, so it was quite the social event.  I had dinner with Kathy and Lachele at the Tavern at Phipps Plaza, and it was a perfect dinner that will stand out in my memory.  It sounds simple or maybe even trite: nachos with cheese, onions, peppers and cubes of chicken in a sweet barbecue sauce, but it food of the gods to me.  I have to go back.  Phipps Plaza is a very high class sort of mall.  It was austere.  Everything about it looks expensive.  And there were no children, no Hispanics, and no black people.  Except a family who were sitting outside, so they didn't count.  I was in high school the last time I was there, and I remember looking in a boutique that had lots of sale racks.  The rack was full of very small t-shirts, and I figured they might be cheap.  The sign on the sale rack advertised: $100 and UP.  The reading was very entertaining despite the overcrowding.  I laughed out loud many times.  He read some pages from his diary as well, so it was nice to hear some new material that I wouldn't have heard otherwise.  He talked about his habit of journal-keeping and commented that he is good at doing exactly the same thing at exactly the same time every day.  I wonder if touring is hard for him, disrupting his routine so much.  Sometimes I can get into a routine of something I want to do, like exercising or writing, and as long as I follow it, it really works for me.  But if I let go of it for just one day, I can't seem to get it back.  I was going to get him to sign my book, but the line was too long, and I couldn't handle the press of people - they weren't allowing me my little bubble of personal space.  The last time I saw him read, I got all my other books signed.  I had prepared in my mind what I would say to him for days - something witty that would make him pay attention to me and see that I really get him.  But of course, when I got up to the table, I was completely tongue-tied and muttered something inane about how nice it must be to live in France.  Gaaaah.   Book Recommendations   David Sedaris recommended  urlLink Random Family , and there was even a pile of them he was encouraging us to pick up on the way to get his book signed.  If I'd stood in line, I would probably have succumbed.  He made it sound fascinating.  Kathy recommended  urlLink Anil's Ghost  - a story about the civil was in Sri Lanka.  She also mentioned wanting to read  urlLink Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books.    Baby Stuff   We got the baby a push toy the other day - a thing he walks with by pushing it in front of him.  After his daddy put it together, he was presented with it, and he seemed to know exactly what to do.  He walked behind the toy until it hit the wall.  Then he dropped down to his knees and crawled away, in search of another amusement.  Things he likes: cords, especially phone cords and blinds cords; the cell phone; chewing paper; biting me; pulling things off a shelf; and the dog.  He has a big unrequited love for the dog. He smiles at her, he shows delight at her every sound and movement, and he tries to follow her around.  She, in return, avoids him, or turns and barks in his face.  He doesn't understand, and his little face seems puzzled after being barked at.  Things he dislikes: finger food, diaper changes, 5:30 in the morning,"	f

"The Daveman here with a bit of an introductory post. I figure I'd just say what music I listen to (i.e. what kind of stuff you might find me posting here). I guess you could dumb down my musical tastes to ""everything"" because I do in fact like almost every conceivable genre out there. It doesn't mean I like all the music I hear, but the chances that I will are pretty good.  Anyway, I'll start off by introducing an artist who has had his hand in a number of musical genres and done well in them all as far as I can tell. He's a bit of an idol of mine, a man by the name of Devin Townsend. He's the lead singer of the heavy metal band Strapping Young Lad and has also formed a punk rock band called Punky Bruster and gone solo to do alternative rock. He has his own label called Hevy Devy Records at http://www.hevydevy.com where you can download a full track from each of the albums he has released. I was able to get a really cool live version of ""Oh My Fucking God"" by Strapping Young Lad from their live album  No Sleep Till Bedtime  from mp3.com, but I don't what's going on with that site nowadays. All of Devin Townsend's work is of high quality, so go check it out any way you can."	f

"I can't really believe what I just read. Apparently,  urlLink Asian Mediawatch  is lobbying hard to make sure that  Lost in Translation , Sofia Coppola's most recent masterpiece, doesn't win a single Oscar this Sunday. They claim that the film is  urlLink racist  and that it perpetuates Japanese stereotypes.  Far be it for me to suggest what people think is and is not racist. Sadly, this is often a matter of perception, and it's such a touchy subject that I don't want to suggest what is and isn't racist, necessarily. In short, if a Japanese person found the film racist, then that's their judgment. What I do take issue with, however, is this statement (from the Guardian online):  ""The film has no meaningful Japanese roles, nor is there any significant dialogue between the main characters and the Japanese. Such portrayals perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes that are harmful to Asian Americans in the US, where a significant minority of Americans already have negative attitudes towards Asians"" (a quote from Asian Mediawatch).  And the question I have in response to this is: did any of the people throwing these claims of racism out there watch the same movie as I did? The film has no meaningful Japanese roles nor significant dialogue between the main characters and the Japanese because that isn't what the movie is about. The movie is about two Americans, masterfully portrayed by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, feeling like fish out of a water in a land that is abjectly foreign to them. It isn't meant to be derogatory, but if the Japanese characters acted like English-fluent Japanese-Canadians or something, there wouldn't have even been a movie to make. Murray and Johansson wouldn't have been fish out of water. They would have been two people visiting a foreign country and having no problem coping with the language and cultural differences.  Asian Mediawatch charges that Coppola maliciously mocked Japanese people's accents by changing ""r""s in the script to ""l""s. But she had this to say for herself: ""Even on our daily call sheets, they would mix up the 'rs' and the 'ls'—all that was from experience, it's not made up. I guess someone has misunderstood my intentions.""  I hope  Lost in Translation  does well at the Oscars, especially because I think this is Bill Murray's best movie to date, and an apt example of why everyone should keep their eye on Ms Coppola's career. Now  that's  what burgeoning is all about, my friends.   It sounds like the people levelling these allegations of racism got lost watching  Lost in Translation ."	m
Happy New Year's everyone!  2004, wow how times flies. The topic of today's blog is probably the same topic of choice for everyone else today: New Year's resolutions.  Do you want to know what my resolution is?  Well, I won't tell you because I don't have a New Year's resolution.  Would you like to know why?  Because New Year's resolutions are for people with no will power.  That's right, lazy people that need an excuse to change something about themselves that they don't like.  If you decide that your resolution is to lose weight, then here's an idea, lose the damn weight.  Don't wait until New Year's so that you can stuff your face and gain twenty pounds during Christmas, start now and do it because your fat!   I'm sorry but why do you have to wait for New Year's?  Recognize the problem and fix it.  Oh, and if you decide to do something, go through with it.  Don't chicken out and give up!	m
I think I have a love/hate relationship with the world right now, I seirously do. I love everything and I hate everything all at the same time. It's annoying, I wish I was just in a love relationship with everyone, everything, and the world.  I hate hw. With that I hate ap us, I hate spanish, I hate school, and I hate grades. I hate tests.  I love the feeling of accomplishment.  I hate losing. In sports, in relationships, in life.  I hate being tierd.  I love the sun.  I love ice cream and popsicles when it's warm up.  I love people. But I also hate people.  I love feeling special.  I love the feeling when you know people care and when people are just there for you.  I hate the feeling when it feels like no one is there for you at all, at least the people that really matter.  I hate things being blown out of proportion.  I hate fighting.  I love make-ups and the sense of assurity after fights.  I love sports.  I hate how sports can kill you.   I hate cancellations.  I love plans.  I love, love. I hate, hate.   All I need is love and I hate it when I don't feel like I have any... but ya of course I love it when I do.  I don't know, I just don't want to feel the hate anymore and I want to stop being moody and stressed and tierd and blah. I hate blahs. I hate feeling blahs more at that. That's why I love people who can get me out of my blahs. Oy, this is going no where else.   KTO	f

Pat?  What should I ask you next?	m
Well I woke up this morning and thought -ahh some time to myself, then realised I should have been at the creche I do at this Talk Together group (some mums of my church get together and do bible study and stuff but they have 10 kids under 3 between them). So phoned them up very apologetically but they were lovely about it.  So did have morning to myself catchin up on writing letters, reading my flatmate's essay, doing a newsletter for Navs tonight.  Then I met up for lunch with 3 girls who I used to do nursing with.  Its really strange because they were the really cool guys who used to sit at the back and basically be 'dead cool'.  I never thought I would have anything to do with them, never knew what to say to them etc (Mel listen to this!)  but then in the second year this girl Danni came up to me one day and asked if we could go for coffee. I was gobsmacked. Turned out she had gone to church when she was at home and believed in God and stuff, but had just totally gone away from it, thought that God was cross with her because she had done tons of not-so-good stuff, slept with some guys etc.  We had a huge chat about it, then I started meeting up with her reasonably regularly and chatting about things and reading the Bible and praying.  It was amazing the change in her. She was stil the same person, part of the cool gang, but she started respecting herself and her decisions, she no longer did things just because everyone else did.  I started sitting with her in lectures and was amazed by how accepting the 'cool group' were of me. I still didn't believe that they liked me but just put up with me because of Danni.  Then they started inviting me out and stuff, I didn't often go, but if I did they would all get really excited.  One time this girl Bronwyn came up to me and said 'you know we all think you are pretty amazing, cos you stick by your beliefs and you don't just merge with the crowd, and yet you don't condemn or look down on us because we don't believe the same or do things you don't agree with.  And you have helped Danni so much, its amazing.  I don't believe in all that christian stuff, but there is something definitely different about you' - I almost passed out!!!  I could not believe my ears (I still don't believe it by the way - well certianly struggle to believe it)  But that has really stuck with me and I can so vividly remember her saying that.    And whilst these girls aren't really good friends and we don't have a lot in common, I know that they actually care and would be there for me if I asked them.  And when I see Danni now, who is going to church, donig sunday school, is even going on a christian camp this Easter, it just makes me smile and feel lovely.  Maybe God can use me even if I'm a bad, useless person!  Am just trying to do some study now (aahh) and then it is Navs tonight. We have a main meeting about International Mission (wish they would do a trip to Canada!)  Oh its been 11 days since I last spoke to Rachel - thats the longest EVER. Struggling not to give in, call her and say it was all my fault.	f
"""hi sweetie""  the first line i read in his IM window in YM.  thanks he's here in manila already.  after 7 days of not speaking to him, finally, meron na ulit chance na makausap at makasama sya.  the next line was...""nagkasakit ako.  hanggang ngayon may lagnat pa nga ako eh."" =( sad na naman ako.  i asked him kung ayaw nya na ko makita..sabi nya..gustong gusto kaso he can't carry himself to me.    this happens most of the time..hirap ng gantong sitwasyon pero i can't do anything about this but to understand him..to understand our situation..  we first met 4 years ago...through a missent text message...then after 3 years..nagkita kame...the first time i saw him, i knew we would have a great connection...nasundan yung first time na yun...then finally we knew we were inlove...kaya lang hindi pede...he was committed to someone else...but still...he likes me and i was head over heels inlove with him...  one day, he called me up...sounded worried..i asked him what's bothering him..he told me...SHE might be pregnant.  my whole world collapsed..i was crying for like 3 days..and then i called him up...do you plan to marry her? he told me, no plans yet..somehow, i still hoped..after a month he called me and told me, wla na kong magawa, kelangan ko sya pakasalan, i was crying like hell nasa office pa ko that time..i asked him, do you want me forget you and never hear from me again? he was crying and said, no, i want you to be always here for me pa ren...pero, half of me, said, let him go..and then, started the end of it (i thought!)..  i started going out again..i thought i am over him...tapos, isang hapon, tinawag ako nung officemate ko, dulz fonecall..**** daw...huy musta ka na, his first line..then we met again...after 5 months, we finally met again...ang ganda ko daw ngayon...and it happened once again..regularly, meet na naman kame...  ndi ko lam baket ganon ang effect nya saken..kahit anong lakad ko, nakacancel ko just for him...all i know is love ko talaga sya..never pang may dumating na boylet saken na hindi ko sinangtabi para sa kanya..too bad, we weren't made for each other..i hope someday or in the next life, ma-meet ko pa rin sya...and sana, kame naman yung made for each other.."	f

"experiment with over the counter diet-aids...  I have been on and off the Atkins diet since August of 2003. In that time I have gone from 207 lbsl to right around 169. Not too bad, but it would definitely have been more if I could keep myself away from sugar. But I just don't think I can do that for extended periods of time. If I am down, I want sugar. If I want to celebrate, it involves sugar. What can you do?  So I have been taking ""Starch Blockers"" for a week or so. They are huge, vitamin like pills that are made from White Kidney Bean extract. Whatever that is. I take them about 30 minutes before I eat anything sugary or starchy. So far them seem to be working. I've eaten scones and Mac-n-Cheese everyday for the past week or so and I haven't gained any weight. I haven't lost any, but I haven't gained any either.  Yesterday I got my first box of ""The Diet Patch."" You wear a patch of about 3 days then change it. The claim is that you will lose about 3 to 7 lbs a week. Not sure if I really believe that, but what the hell. I haven't had any weird side effects yet and if someone will experience them, it would be me. Only time will tell. We have a ""cheat"" weekend planned for this weekend, so we'll see if I lose or gain..."	f

Once again he acts as though I don't exist. We were on the phone, and Brittney wasn't answering. So he called her again. I hate how he acts like him talking to me is a gift to me. No problem. Then again. Then again. Like I wasn't there; like he had nobody to fucking talk to. Not his best friends =/. Whatever.    Pissed off... again.    .Credits  Mike - Good friend in Illinois.

hmmm. everyone seems to have links on their blogs now. all the more reason for me not to and then i can pretend that it's that and not just that i can't work out how to (i;m sure i could if i tried). I#ve decided my problem is i want excitement in life, but not enough excitement to make it happen. for instance i walked through the living room one evening when mum and rod were watching a film on video and i just cought sight of one bi, where two people had arrived too late somewhere and had to sleepp on a small bench ti wait for the morning. it's not much but it;s just so different. and in 'Amelie' when she sleeps in a phone box. ok it;s not just about sleeping in strange places there's just so much excitement out there for people who know how to get at it. people who have all sorts of jobs. generally the jobs that appeal to me are ones that don't really require much education. in fact i really fancy trying out being a maid. a real old fashioned one that has to do loads of things like polishing silver and things, though i hate saying that because i always feel that i'm being too posh and middle class wanting to try out stuff that the poorer classes do, but it's not. for one thing i'm not middle class, i don't see anyone as poorer class, or any class at all realy, and i don't like to think of there being people 'lower' than i am, exactly. this isn't working out very well. every word makes me sound more pompous, but in truth i hate any way of distinguishing between different types of people. we're all people after all. but what i'm saying is i like stuff that's more than just...cleverness. hmm i always wanted to be a waitress when i was little and there;s other things which i forget. i just get the feeling that you get to meet more interesting people that way, thoough i don't know why. and anyway, i'm sure that there's plenty of interesting people in teaching. it's just sometimes i get fed up of the idea of qualifications always being important and higher education and things. which is silly because really i love education, which sounds odd, but it means you're so free in many ways, at least at school, while t's compulsory because you can't earn a living really and you have less burdons of responsibility etc. if i had a chioce i'd love to stay around this age and at school for a good while longer, but of course it can't happen. and now i'm leaving compulsory education and will soon start to run up bills and all that rubbish which is so silly. Ho hum. oh dear i don't really know what i want. it's just my life is all prepared, A levels, UNi and then, if i'm still interested, PGCE. as long as i'm still alive of course. and for noce it would be interesting to not know. in some ways it would be fun in the short term to fail some GCSEs but i don';t want to really and i do want to go to uni. and do a levels and i don't want to fail at all. i do tend to talk about myself rather don't i. i suppose that that's the point but still it feels a little selfish. i do wish that i hadn't given up creative writing because i did enjoy it, but i just can't write anything now, anything good ir not fact like this, or whatever it is. and i'm not saying that this is good either. but i miss creative writing sometimes. i will miss it. it's just that the one story that other people liked was sort of original and though i can think of other ideas they never work and i'm so rarely in the mood to write anything that if i start something one night i'm liable not to ever finish it, or more probably, put it in the  recycled paper basket after wri[[ing it up, which usually makes me feel better. i hope all this makes no sense really. i think i go a bit odd after not seeing anyone a) that isn't my family and/or b) isn't remotely near my age. seeing Ben is very nice, but to stay slightly... well not sane but un-odd t helps to see people that are friends out of choice too, though i like ben loads not just because he's my brother, though i'm glad he is. agani this probably dosen't make sense. like he very odd jazz on the radio which i don't like at all. it's like some of the modern art work, it's gone past nice and is just silly, but people can get away with it because they're famous. like turning a bike upsidown and calling it are, or hitting a violin with a pencil (as this music sounds) and calling it Jazz. but that's late friday night on radio three for you i suppose. well goodnight.

"the other night i met a few friends for some drinks, laughs, and fattning food.  when we hang out together, we always seem to play a game of questions. The game is like truth or dare, but only with questions of truth and no dares. We ask questions like, where do you see yourself in ten years, how much money do i have to pay you to sleep with me, etc etc etc :).  well one of the questions was, ""what is one thing you would change about yourself?"" the first person to answer was female, and she said something about her body... and that started the trend of answering the question with physical traits.   and i got to thinking... how come nobody answered with traits that would make them a better person, not just a better mold of society's beautiful.  even i fell victim, saying if i had to change anything it would be my hairy arms. :) but, there are hundreds of other things i wish were different. i wish i were more patient sometimes, i wish i were more self-motivated, organized, disciplined, giving, and a whole other laundry list of virtues.... but, i do work on those things every day. if we don't try to work on our faults, our ways of life that aren't making the world a better place, what's the point of being here? there has to be a purpose to life and i truely don't beleive it's to honk at that guy who cut in front of me, or to shut everyone out while i stay too focused on school to realize what's going on in the rest of the world.  the way i figure, hairy arms aint' so bad. :)"	f

Haldo to everyone.  This is Kevin/KDawg, the ex freshman/senior roommate of Skiz. So any trace of mental instability can be traced bak to him.  Long story short: At a career fair at (much greater than Lafayette) Lehigh University, I saw an Uncle Sam bobblehead doll. I wanted that so I figured I'd talk to the people at the table, a little company called Raytheon. I gave my resume but didn't think much past getting the bobblehead. They called a week later and I figured I'd go do a practice interview(I had no intention of moving out to State College).  They impressed me, made a good offer in November, Lockheed in Philly had its thumbs up its ass, and I'm here now.  So that's my intro. I start my job later today which is also the day I start my official blogging career.  I had more stuff about how Pittsburgh sports are terrible to watch including this gem: The Penguins are so broke they can barely afford the case of Milwaukee's Best Mario buys the team when they reach twenty points right around March of every year. However, I'll hold off on that in order to keep my first post short.  Tagline...tagline...poop shitty. Sounds good to me	m

I have talked to him on the phone, but not that much because I was busy.   I went to Pin OAk downtown on Saturday which was really sad because I went through a ""that could be me"" phase or whatever. Saw a bunch of people that I know that brought back sad feelings from December. And, of course, whenever we are around Saddlebred people, Dorothy comes up again. Steve is in the hospital because he isn't taking care of himself, drinking, living from social security check to check, etc...   But anyways... Time for homework."	f

Some Days are Better Than Others  By Duf Fer  Sitting here like a bump on a log, Trying to conjure ideas for a blog, Suddenly it occurs to me: Blogging ain't all ways E-Z. I know that what I write is true Or others would be blogging too. So, there are days we write a ton; And there are days that we write none But still no matter what the weather Our Blog will always stay together And though our post day wasn't great There's still the five of us (don't hate).	m

Many people that I know always complain to me that they recieve a ton of pop-ups and their computer is painfully slow. Most of the time I diagnose the problem as some sort of   spyware   or malware has been installed on the computer.  Some very common and nasty spyware programs are   Gator  ,   Weather Bug  , and   Bonzi Buddy  .      The steps to remove spyware are very easy. First you need to download some free utilities. Many companies will try to sell you software to remove spyware. Don't buy them. The programs below work a lot better and are FREE.      Spybot Search  Destroy    This is a Great Program.  When you first start it up be sure to check for updates and imunize your system.        AdAware    This program is also good.  Make sure to check for updates.      Another problem that people have is browser hijacks. If you have ever had you homepage changed without you changing it yourself, you have probably been hijacked. To remove these hijacks use the program CW Shredder.      CW Shredder    This program runs very fast so run it often!	m
"Psych Hospital, Part II  Thursday, March 9, 2000 I feel much better today than I have in a while. By last night things seemed to be better but this morning I am kind of restless. R. came by yesterday and gave me communion and talked for a while which was nice. I also had the opportunity to read one of the books he gave me-it was good and has some interesting insights. J. also sent me a bunch of stuff, magazines, cookies, etc. In group yesterday people talked about some things that made alot of sense to me. Much of the time I think that there is not much I do well and I was remembering how I have always been the ""dippy"" one, the one who didn't quite get things right. I think I probably need to  start thinking about things I do well and change how I think about the things I don't believe I do well. I had said a couple of days ago that for a goal I was going to write 3 things that I did well or liked about myself, so I guess now would be a good time to do that. 1. I help others when they need it. 2. I work well with gardening. 3. I enjoy working with animals  In the afternoon yesterday we had anger management and I realized (once again) that I do not hand anger well. Often when someone does something that upsets me I find some way to turn my anger at them to myself-I always make it my fault.  I am supposed to go home tomorrow. Earlier today I felt good but now I am feeling pretty nervous. Before dinner I was reading to one of the other patients and she got upset. I felt really responsible but I have tried to make myself believe that it wasn't. One of the mental health care workers was very mean to her earlier today and they changed some of her routines. Then P. and Mom came by to talk about what will happen and how they can help me when I leave. Now I am very anxious and can't seem to calm myself. I asked earlier for an extra dose of medicine but they asked me to wait to see if my regular medicine would work-it hasn't.  I guess I realize that this isn't a minor thing. In some ways my life will never be the same. I have to change things, I have to do some catch-up on things and I will need to be more vigilante to make sure I don't get as far depressed as I  have been.  Friday, March 10, 2000 It's Friday night and I am at home again. The past week has been an interesting and enlightening experience. I met people from many different backgrounds and discovered a very important lesson-we are all human and susceptible to the same highs and lows in life. I really have a very different perspective on those suffering from subtance abuse. While the thought of coming home was scary, I am feeling fairly comfortable. I know the feeling won't last, but I am going to try and remember things I have learned this past week. In order to get well and stay well I need to do the following: 1. Take meds. 2. Take time for me (15 minutes or more). 3. Control my anger. 4. Learn to love myself  I will try to record what I have done each day to meet the last three goals. Today I spent time quietly in my room thinking about coming home, I maintained a calm demeaner when dealing with G., realized that my ability to organize helps keep the family together. I also felt gratitude and blessings in the form of P. and G. I need to be thankful for all my family and friends.  Sunday, March 12, 2000 Last night I had a little problem with thoughts of cutting myself. It was a little overwhelming at the coffee hour after church. There seemed to be too many people. I also had some trouble during a presentation by R. There were lots of images of the crucifixition. E. and J came down for G.'s birthday. She is always very good to G. In addition to a gameboy game (Pokemon Pinball) we went to Toys R Us. G got rollerblades and so we could go together, I got a pair myself. We tried them out and they seem great. Today I: 1. Took all my meds, but left out the one for stiff joints since I wasn't feeling too stiff. 2. I have yet to take my 15 minutes, but I am going to try some knitting. 3. I was firm with G. when he was pushing playing with his stuffed animal in church. I didn't yell, I just removedif and put it in the pew and warned him I would take it away for the day. No problem after that. 4. Getting roller blades was good for me because I can take them with me and go skating on campus.  [These proved to be more than I could do and eventually they went to the swap shop.]"	f
Im sure this will stir up alot of debate, but id love the discussion.   The Presidents top priorities are winning the war, protecting the homeland and generating economic growth and jobs, and he has continued to lead boldly on these priorities. However, the lagging economy and weak stock market caused revenues to decline further, which explains the biggest change in the budget position, followed by the costs of the war and the economic growth plan. Although large in nominal terms, these deficits are manageable and the Administration plans to cut the deficit in half in a few years through a combination of economic growth and spending restraint. Thanks to the President delivering on a 3rd consecutive growth plan and other factors, the economy seems poised for a strong recovery.     Budget projections from the Federal Budget Submission Fiscal Year 2003      304 Billion  Fiscal Year 2004      307 Billion  Fiscal Year 2005      208 Billion  Fiscal Year 2006      201 Billion  Fiscal Year 2007     178 Billion  Fiscal Year 2008      190 Billion  At the end of Fiscal Years 2004-08 1.08 Billion    The Deficit Is Manageable. The deficit is manageable given the shocks our economy has endured (recession, terrorist attacks, revelation of corporate scandals, and a weak market). At 4.2% of GDP, it is well below the 1983 peak modern-day deficit of 6% (its not even in the top five). In fact, it is the same or smaller than deficits following similar recessions. These deficits are not hurting the economy right now, as interest rates are at 45-year lows.   Cut the Deficit With Economic Growth and Spending Restraint. The fundamentals  lower taxes, a positive outcome in Iraq, strong housing markets, record low interest rates, renewed consumer confidence, low inflation -- are in place for a strong recovery and job growth. Tax refund checks are on the way. A strong economy and spending restraint will cut the deficit by more than half. Economic growth creates surpluses, not the other way around.  Tax Relief is Helping the Economy Recover. Economists generally agree that the 2001 tax relief helped combat the recession, and that the latest growth and jobs package will help spark investment, recovery and job creation. Now is exactly the wrong time to raise taxes.   The Need for Spending Discipline. The Presidents budget holds growth in discretionary spending below 4% (less than half the growth rate of recent years) because government spending should not grow faster than family income. In fact, spending growth outside of defense and homeland security has been slowed from 6.0% in FY02, to 4.7% in FY03, to a proposed 2.0% in FY04 (compared to a near 15% spike in FY01). The Presidents budget would also re-impose spending caps and pay-as-you-go requirements to help slow spending further.  Recession, Plunging Revenues and the War  Not Tax Relief  Brought Back the Deficit.    The overwhelming reason for the change in deficit from the February projection continues to be the impact of the recession and previously weak market on tax revenues. Revenues dropped for three years in a row, which hasnt happened in the U.S. since the 1920s. The recession and its revenue effects erased 100% of the projected FY 2002 surplus.   The response to the attacks of September 11th resulted in unanticipated but necessary spending of roughly $180B to prosecute the war on terrorism (including Operation Iraqi Freedom), build a robust homeland security system, and rebuild New York. Both parties overwhelmingly supported this additional spending.  If there had been NO TAX CUTS, not in 2001, 2002, or 2003, the budget would be in triple digit deficits today ($278B in 2003).	m

"Another Saturday night well spent!  Chris, Cindy (Chris's sister), and her new boyfriend John,  I went to an Italian restaurant and then to the Upright Citizens Brigade last night.  Good time though I must say that the UCB seems to have blown up in popularity since our last visit about a month ago.  Still a good time no matter how many uptight college kids bump into me in line without saying ""excuse me.""  Before the show started, the 4 of us perused the grocery store next to the theatre where we happened to see a couple of the actors/comedians from the UCB.  One of the guys does spots on VHI for shows like  The 80's Strikes Back  and  The Best Week Ever .  It probably won't be the last time I see these guys since Chris will begin taking improv classes in early March.  He's been wanting to do this for a while, so I'm glad he got off his ass and signed up - oh, that's right, I had to actually sign him up.  Well, close enough.

"Last night I went to see a high school basketball all-star  urlLink game ;  you thought basketball season was over.  More times than I want to count, I have heard athletes, usually when they are involved in some controversy, state: I didn't ask to be a role model. This infuriates me, because, like it or not, asked for or not, they are.  So as I'm sitting watching this all-star game, I'm leafing through the program  come across the profile for  urlLink Anthony Marquis Ivory . Under the ""What do I want to be"" part of the profile, he responded, a role model! I really liked that!

"Bill Moyers discusses how the media is controlled by several individuals with very close ties to the GOP. Something very important in wake of all of the censorship being practiced in the media. Here's an excerpt:   urlLink ""That's Sinclair's prerogative, of course. Every news organization has First Amendment rights, just as I'm exercising mine right now. But speaking out is one thing, keeping others from being heard is another. Sinclair censored Koppel.""   I remember when we didn't censor so much; the economy was good, more people were employed, and we weren't being force-fed lies. If you don't like something then change the channel. If you have children watching, be a parent and take care of what they watch and explain things to them. Don't give up your rights and your power to others just because it makes your life a little easier. Do not let people tell you how to think and act and live because there are people out there who are more than willing to make every decision for you. This is not a daycare. We're all adults and should act accordingly.   You know what's right. Do you really need someone telling you how to feel and what to think every second of your life? We should all be responsible human beings that are accountable for actions."	m

I would just like everyone to know that today I am wearing my pink and brown stripped socks and my pink  brown blouse. It makes me happy. This is a good thing, because today is going to be a  LONG  day. But my paper is done, this also makes me happy. It makes me happy for several reasons 1) it means that i do not lose 5%, b) i can go snowboarding on sat guilt free, c) i am done before gavin. Now, if only i can get a better mark then him, then truly all will be wonderous.  Emails make me happy as well and so do comments on the blog. So I would strongly suggest and urge you to do both today, because it would MAKE     my day even happier.  Have a good day!!!

"Some Radical Conservative pseudo-Christians have decided now to  urlLink secede  from the Union.  This actually isn't a bad idea.  It would be great to ship all of these people into one geographic area and maybe they will shut up and leave the rest of us alone.    The nut leading this movement is unclear on the specifcs:    For now, Burnell prefers to shy away from specifics on the precise laws governing the country.   ""Independence first, details later,"" he says   Hmmm.  Why is he so reluctant to share the details?  Maybe because they want to outlaw things like sodomy?  Such a desire is not only bizarre but it seems to be a pretty clear violation of basic civil liberties.  Keep in mind that some anti-sodomy laws ban such things as blowjobs and other forms of hetero sex.  Banning sodomy is one of these nuts' goals as indicated by their complaint that ""Sodomy is now legal...""  I'd like to see how their little so-called Christian republic works out."	m

I haven't posted for such a long timeI didn't even think about it. He was the first drummer I went to see live. I actually went to see him especially at Jazz Alley in Seattle. He was among my favorite drummers, and I stumbled into his dressing room whenI went to see him. He gave me a bottle of water out of his little fridge. We chatted in between his sets, and he was a really nice guy. During his second set, he looked at me while he was playing. I was right down front and he looked right at me, and pointed withone of hissticks and smiled. I was the most self aware moment I've evert had. It would be as if you were watching TV, and your favorite character jumped out and said ""hey."" I truly idolized Elvin, and now he's gone forever. I will never be able to go to another show of his, and ask if he remembers, of if I was one of many."	m
"CARROT TOP  I just finished watching that new Colin Quinn show, Politically Incorrect and Carrot Top was one of the guests.    Watching him tonight, brought back a memory of a New Year's Eve 3 years ago, when I was partying at someone's house that I didn't know and the TV was on and Carrot Top was performing.  He was wearing this skin tight t-shirt and talking into a mike and throwing props around the stage.  I could not hear a word he was saying, but he looked really good and I realized at that moment, that he is hot and worthy of crushdom.    So watching him tonight, I remembered that I have a crush on Carrot Top.  Carrot Top.  (aka Scott Thompson)  Tight body. Wild red hair. Dreamy eyes and that quiet confidence a man has when he's got something special in his pants.  In the dream, I am counting his freckles and he is counting mine.  And then somewhere later in the dream, I've just gotten him a gig at the Westbury Music fair and I'm bringing him a glass of icy cold lemonade.  He's in the tool shed creating a combination regular household item topical joke thing.  He is so touched by my concern for his thirst that he thanks me and throws me down on the heart shaped bed that we have in the tool shed for just such occasions, he kisses me on the cheek and then says ""Go make me dinner, I have to finish my comic prop thing.""   and then I fix his eyebrows."	f
"President Bush's  urlLink Military Records ???  What about  urlLink this article    ============================================  a few more things by the way   Please contact both Bush and Cheney at the following email addresses, send them the following list of 20 questions, demand an answer!   president@whitehouse.gov vice.president@whitehouse.gov  Courtesy of a Mr Kelley from the Anti War, Pro Peace mailing list, we have the following list of 20 questions:  1. President Bush, were you arrested for cocaine in 1972 in Harris County, Texas (Houston area)?  2. President Bush, in 1972 did your father arrange to have your cocaine arrest expunged from the records through a judge, a close-acquaintance of your fathers, in exchange for you to perform community service at Project Pool, a Houston inner-city program that mentors youth in poor neighborhoods?  3. President Bush, was your friend from the National Guard, James R. Bath, arrested for cocaine around the same time? Is this why both of your National Guard records show suspensions in 1972 for refusal to submit to annual medical exams? Is this why you were no longer allowed to fly? If so, why did you make up the story that you no longer WANTED to fly?  4. President Bush, do you remember Bill Calhoun from your National Guard duty in Alabama? No one else remembers your serving in the National Guard in Alabama at that time, but ""coincidentally"" the Republican National Committee suddenly found this Bill Calhoun to vouch for you. Is Mr. Calhoun a paid operative of the Republican Party? Or did he just volunteer to lie to save your reputation?  5. James R. Bath was appointed by your father as a CIA operative in 1976 leasing aircraft in Houston and serving as a liaison between wealthy Arab sheiks (including the Bin Ladens) and American entrepreneurs. According to all sources, Baths company served as a front for the CIA. Before 1976, Bath was broke, according to all accounts. What was it that prompted your father to select James R. Bath in 1976? Did he hold incriminating evidence against you?  6. James R. Bath, representative of wealthy Saudi sheiks, channeled investment money into your first company in 1977, Arbusto Energy Corporation of Midland, Texas. Were you personally acquainted with Salem bin Laden (Osamas brother) and Khalid bin Mahfouz (Osamas brother-in-law) who poured thousands into your first company and millions into your subsequent enterprises?  7. Mr. Bush, how did you profit $880,000 from Harken Energy (your fourth company), when all other investors lost 90%? Why didnt the SEC (under your fathers administration) look into the matter of your sale of stock a week before the stock collapsed?  8. Mr. Bush, how did Harken Energy (who had never explored off-shore) land the contract off Bahrain in 1990 when your father was President of the United States? Who, then, worked up the sweetheart deal under the table?  9. Khalid bin Mahfouz, whose younger sister married Osama bin Laden, was director of the powerful Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and also served as director of BCCI (Bank of Credit  Commerce International) which laundered money for the CIA under the watch of your father. He was also part of the IRAN-CONTRA scheme (Ollie North) and the savings  loan debacle of the 80s. Mahfouz was also one of your prime investors (through James R. Bath, your Guard buddy) in your 4 failed firms. Khalid bin Mahfouz has also been tagged by the CIA for funneling millions to his brother-in-law, Osama, since the 1980s through 2004. Why, then, are you EXEMPTING Mahfouzs banking activities from being closed down? The 9/11 families especially WANT TO KNOW. (9/11 families are incensed at Bush for exempting these Saudi royals connected to Osama bin Laden.)  10. Why will you not release the August 6, 2001 brief from the CIA (delivered to you personally at Crawford) as part of the 9/11 Investigation? Did the memo not warn that Al Qaeada was planning imminent hijackings flying airliners into American buildings?  11. Mr. President, did you authorize contracting out the gathering of intelligence to a group called OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS? Was not this group closely associated with the Republican Party? Did the OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS circumvent the use of the CIA for the sole purpose of lending credibility to your pre-conceived notion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was poised to use them against the U.S. and its allies? Was there another ulterior motive in contracting OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS ($80 million taxpayer money)? Since OSP is a private enterprise, the Congress cannot oversee its operations. Thus, you were free to dismiss any congressional inquiries. Is this correct?  12. Mr. President, who was on staff at the OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS? Were they not close to your administration and were part of the formation of PNAC (Project for a New American Century) in 1997? Was not the PNAC determined to invade Iraq regardless if Saddam was there or not even if no WMD existed?  13. Mr. President, did not the PNAC write a policy statement in September 2000 in which they believed a new Pearl Harbor was necessary to rouse Americans to back a war against Iraq?  14. Mr. President, name members of your administration who also serve or have served with the Project for a New American Century (PNAC  15 An organization/business called CARLYLE GROUP, whose members include 3 Bin Laden brothers, your father, James Baker, Frank Carlucci, and several others from your administration, serves as a conduit for weapons sales between major defense contractors and governments all over the world. CARLYLE also rebuilds defense companies both financially and through market availability. Mr. President, you also served with the CARLYLE GROUP 1990-92. Dont you find this organization and its members in conflict of interest since they come directly from high government positions and are now selling weapons systems to those same governments? Dont you find it a conflict of interest when the CARLYLE GROUP advises governments what weapons systems to procure and what strategies to use against potential enemies?  16. Mr. President, were you really born again upon Billy Grahams visit to your fathers summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine? Or was this another ploy to cover your future political aspirations where you foresaw the need to sway the Southern vote to lock up elections?  17. Mr. President, did God really speak to you in 1999 and predict your rise to the presidency? While you were sitting at your mothers church in Houston?  18. Mr. President, did God really direct you to strike Afghanistan, then Iraq, and then turn your attention to the 2004 election? (As you claimed to the Prime Minister Mahmoud Abba of the Palestinians)  According to Abbas, immediately after the peace negotiations Bush said: ""God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them."" June 25, 2003 Ha'aretz - Israeli Press Article  19. Mr. President, who were the White House staffers who leaked information to Bob Novak and five other prominent journalists concerning Ambassador Joseph Wilsons wife, Valerie Plame, a CIA operative? Wasnt vengeance their prime motive? Did you or your closest adviser, Karl Rove, have knowledge of the leak at the time, and did you approve?  20. Mr. President, name the company executives who sat down with Vice-President Cheney at the energy policy meetings of early 2001. Was not Ken Lay chief among them? What did they discuss and what were their plans? If Cheney and the energy planners motives were pure, why not release the names and information to the public? Or at least to Congress?"	m

HW for K... Session 5. 1.  finish the studies about The Story of His Glory 2.  email the list of 5-7 questions to two or three missionaries you or your family support.  also send me the list and I get to send them out to two or three that  I support. 3.  Do these studies based on Paul and his missionary journets.  (If you are reading this blog, somehow, and are interested in these studies, email me and I will send them to you.  However, they are based on material covered in Perspectives.) K leaves for college in 10 days or so, so I think the final step would be to put together a survey to see what he found the most helpful. That would be kind of fun.  In other developments, met a guy named Dan the other night from a local church, who came and did a presentation about God's Mission to the college age worship night at GCC.  Very cool.  And then they showed the  video for Urbana 03.  I think the majority of my dteam guys are interested, very very cool.  I think Dan and I might dialogue about mobilization, which would be great.	m

Looking back, I think I've made a lot of mistakes. Big ones and little ones. I never claimed I was perfect. But even now as i'm realizing current mistakes i've made, some even public to strangers, I know I've learned from them. But I also wonder if I'm ever going to get this right, this whole life thing. It seems like its constant uphill battle and each year I'm just carrying more luggage with me. I just want to drop it all and walk on even  ground for awhile.  I've been thinking a lot about people from my past, what they are doing, how they are doing, etc. As much as I want to know, I know that it is too soon to ask. And then there are some who I could care less if I ever hear their name again. I don't know what kind of person i'm turning into. Its someone different than I thought a year ago. And i don't know if its for the better or worse. I have great friends, different ones than five years ago, but all amazing people that i hope to know for the rest of my life. I have a great job that i love, plus i get my summers off(not really cuz i don't get a paycheck). But its something i can see myself doing for the next couple of years, until i get more organized in my educational plans(grad school, etc).  Maybe i got so messed up because everything was falling into place, and i needed something to keep me on the edge of my seat. Not that i did anything wrong, but i think i allowed myself to enter/create a situation that i really shouldn't waste my energy on. The whole thing still bothers me in someways. I'm angry at how i let them control the situation, or rather how rick controlled the situation. Or maybe it bothers me because i don't really know what happened. Not to say that would help me in anyway.  But.  I don't like to be lied to. I was manipulated in the worst way from him. He was the last person I thought would ever do something like that.  All i know now is that she stayed with him. she's having a baby in a month. and then i think they are getting married or something. which is all fine i mean they can do what ever they want. its all over, the whole drama. But I still hate the way i acted. Not that I would ever apologize because frankly i don't think they deserve it.  I think i acted immaturely. I should have let it go way before i did.   Only in retrospect does that seem clear.	f
This time every year my thoughts turn to   urlLink Kubota Diesel Generators , an excellent diesel generator that runs whisper quiet and supplies ample amounts of electricity to power an entire home. The neighbor up the street installed one after Typhoon Chata'an last year, and he certainly got his money's worth out of it after Typhoon Pongsana.

We were all seething with envy during the gasoline shortage immediately after the typhoon too, because diesel supplies were unaffected by the fuel dump fire. While we sweltered in darkness, his Kubota purred along all night powering his air conditioner, refrigerator, lights and television.  Of course the  urlLink thing costs over $13,000 , but it's worth it. Besides,  urlLink Morrico , the local dealer for Kubota, offers excellent service and repair options.  I mention this because I read  urlLink Paul Boutin's   urlLink article  at  urlLink Slate  about the joys of owning a backup generator for power outages. When he quoted $2100 for a 2.5 kW generator, I about choked on my breakfast. That guy got fleeced. Morrico sells  urlLink a rock-solid 6.5 kW gasoline generator for $2150 . And that's ridiculously expensive. After Chata'an, Dianne bought a 5.5 kW  urlLink Porter-Cable   urlLink gasoline generator for $600 , plus shipping. If all you need is to run a few light bulbs or a fan, I'd suggest getting a  urlLink power inverter  for the car, which changes the 12 volt DC power into AC for the household appliances to use. It's good for a temporary solution, which is all most people will ever need.  I'm off to the movies now, perhaps I'll write more about alternative power sources like solar and fuel cells this evening.	m
"Check out this definition of  urlLink ""time porn""  from The Word Spy.  In the spirit of that phrase, when I got my new MacConnection catalogue - blasted junk mail! - I thought of a new word:  Tech porn.  Tech porn is the catelogues from OfficeMax, the gear reviews on reviews.CNET.com, the front page of the Apple website.    40 GB iPods! 5 Megapixel digital cameras! Portable LCD projectors with handheld wireless remote that reaches over 500 yards so you can wander during presentations!  I can't afford this stuff!  I don't even need this stuff!  But, sister, do I want this stuff!  I'm from a long line of gadget hounds; I can't even remember the number of PDA's and digital cameras my Dad's bought in the past 2 years.  Tech porn is a more specific subset of gadget porn.  A picture of a DLC-X Plus 20-cup capacity Cuisinart food processor in Martha Stewart Living is gadget porn.  If the processor has a Wi-Fi internet connection so you can command it to mix zucchini bread dough through the laptop you're using as you sip a light frappichino at Starbucks - that's tech porn.  And Steve Jobs is the number one pusher."	f

urlLink Blake Wylie  investigates the problems inherent in gun control - increases in crime rates.  The correlation seems obvious, which is probably why we didn't hear a peep out of the Million Mom March types at the DNC this year. It's a losing issue.  It's an issue that largely cost Gore Tennessee in 2000 (in addition to wholesale abandonment of the state years before). We in the South, and elsewhere who understand how to properly use firearms have long understood this. The places where the Dems are going to win anyway, where the populace sees the gun as some mythical orb of destruction, many of whom have never actually touched a real firearm, are never going to understand the issue pragmatically anyhow. So the result? Don't mention it.  Ireland has wholesale banned firearms on the island for some time now.  The criminal mind, which most assuredly is more intuitive than the progressive liberal mind, has taken notice.  Next time you go to Ireland, order a kevlar vest along with your pint of Smithwick's.   England has a similar gun policy, and has experienced the expected rise in crime.  The all-knowing officials in the UK attempt to explain the rise in crime in terms of low wages, which have created a land of inopportunity.  Problem is, the lack of the most efficient method of civilian protection creates an even larger land of opportunity for those who specialize in theft and intimidation.  Geeze.  Sometimes it hurts the brain to be progressive.	m
I may not remember everyhing I pondered over last night, but this is one thing I recall...   Why do we wish for a normal life? I realized that, many a time, I have wanted nothing more than a normal life. I have complained because my life was so different from what everyone else's seemed to be, and I have wanted to be just like them. I have felt bad for having a completely odd and twisted story to tell that may get uncanny looks thrown at me, and I always seem to have a completely odd and twisted story for anything worth telling...  Why?!  A conversation with my sister and a good look in the mirror helped me remember that, fundamentally, diversity is what makes me me. And, after that occurrance, I am very glad that my nose was broken ten years ago and never quite returned to looking straight and that I don't often look like a photocopy of someone else... that I have oversized ex-soccer player legs and four cheeks when I smile, and, more importantly, that I cannot match my life to any book that's been written (that I have read thus far, anyway, technically), or that I can't relate to most stories published on Seventeen magazine and such others...   This is what it means to be different.	f
"I spent the entire lecture staring at him, or whenever the lecturer was talking writing about him. But that was purely because I was basing a slash character on him. He has the most fantastic eyes, I don't even think there is a word for the colour that they are. It's kinda like the colour of the ocean except really light. And he has the nicest hair, it's really dark brown - almost black. He keeps it hidden under a trucker ha, which is a similar colour to his eyes. He has a really simple goatee too just a parch under his chin. All of his clothes match his hat and his eyes. Well, at least i know he's gay *giggles*  This guy is so hot he defines the word Hotacular. If you type into google ""Define: Hotacular"" it will have a picture of him.

We received an email a few days ago from one of the deans here on campus.  Here's an excerpt:   Dear students:  I hope that no one needs to use this policy, but it is there if the worst occurs.  Policy: Any request, or other relief regarding examinations, that may involve retaking an examination based upon a claim of physical, mental or emotional illness or  distress  at the time of taking the original examination (from which relief is sought) must be made before the commencement of such examination or at such other time as may be permitted under extraordinary circumstances, but in no event later than the date the examination grade is posted.   I found this to be interesting--the fact that law school exams can be so stressful that a school has a policy set in case someone becomes so out of their mind they cannot take the exam.  Now, I realize how much we have riding on these tests--the entire grade is based upon one test; our first year grades are the most important in finding our second year summer associate posistion (and ultimately a permanent position); selection for Law Review is based upon first year grades--you get the point...but does anyone ever really freak out so much it becomes physically impossible for them to take an exam?    Maybe there is something wrong with me (and the majority of my friends).  I haven't encountered anyone (yet) who is incredibly stressed out.  Here I am, in Boca Grande at the beach--yeah, I'm studying but I'm not holed up in the library 24/7 (which is impossible since it's only open until 12).  I justified my driving time by listening to the  Sum  Substance Criminal Law CDs , which are read by the author of my book (Dressler) and are pretty damn good.  Granted I get a little distracted at times by scenery, other cars, or my own random thoughts, but I still feel like I'm being productive.  I went to bed around midnight last night and slept for 8 hours.  Maybe I'm too relaxed, I don't know.  I guess I'll find out when I get my grades.  Luckily, if I learn that I need to be a little more uptight to get better grades I can change my outlook while I only have two grades riding on an exam week instead of five.  I suppose now I should quit musing about my lack of stress in studying for exams and start actually studying, as to prevent the possibility of an impending freak out.  :)  I'll post more later.	f

"LIL AMBER  JOHN ASHCROFT:   We were discussing  ASHCROFT V. FREE SPEECH COALITION , 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  I was somewhat less than prepared.  Well, really the only thing I missed was why  New York v. Ferber  458 U.S. 747 (1982) wasn't controlling.   Thing was, I had already done this case in 1st Amendment Law and knew it, I just couldn't believe the Professor had gotten through the class list a full second time.  Hell, he already called on me the week before darn it!  Eh, I redeemed myself reasonably well I think when I noted that the Court said that if Congress wanted to prevent the conduct that this virtual child porn led to (exploitation, seduction, etc), it should have criminalized the conduct itself, not the protected speech.   Then again, maybe not.    **END LAME ATTEMPT TO COVER ONE'S ASS** **BEGIN SEMI-SUBSTANTIVE POST**   Ok, so while I understand that you can't ban visual depictions that  appear  to be of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, what do we say about sites like  urlLink Lil Amber  and similar ""teen modeling"" sites that seems pretty clearly directed towards a prurient interest (even if they may not wholly satisfy the  Miller  obscenity standards of being patently offensive and lacking serious social/literary/etc value)?  Can't such sites be constitutionally classified, by statute, as being child pornography? Or do such statutory definitions also fall prey to a  Miller -like analysis--at least in terms of sweeping in too much protected speech. (I.E., is the overbreadth hurdle easier to get over when defining child porn--so long as it involves REAL children?)   **UPDATE**  I went to the mountaintop ( urlLink Prof. Volokh ) and asked him the same question. Response is that  United States v. Knox , 32 F.3d 733 is on point. Case involved a prosecution under a federal child porn statute for possesion of videos that had minors in provacative poses in ""abbreviated"" clothing.  To quote LEXIS:  ""The court affirmed the defendant's conviction, because the federal child pornography statute did not contain a requirement that the child subject's genitals or pubic area be fully or partially exposed or discernible, and the requirement of lasciviousness applied to the exhibition of the child's body rather any act, pose, or intent on the part of the child subject."""	m

Former Take That member Mark Owen makes a strong comeback with 'In Your Own Time'      The general idea when Take That, England's biggest pop-sensation since The Beatles, broke up in 1996 was that Mark Owen (and not Robbie Williams) would be the one who would do good as a solo artist. Mark Owen's 1996 solo debut 'Green Man' was promesing and did good on the charts, but he never came up with a follow up and the world was soon under the spell of Robbie Williams.  Mark Owen wanted to find his 'own voice' and become a better songwriter before he would return to the record studio and that is what happened in 2003. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for something good and this is the case with Mark Owen's 2004 release 'In Your Own Time' is exactly that, something good.  This is britpop in its purest form, highly addictive and well produced. Mark as a singer has developed and he proves himself as a very capable songwriter. This is one of those albums where you push 'play' and just let it play from first to last track: This is easy going, well written music, where no particular song stands out as greater than the other.	f
currently listening to: ace troubleshooter - yesterday   it's nice to move out, but not when you have to relocate away from your friends and loved ones.  but it's something i had to do i guess, either that or i would've been a bum living at home with no job still.  well the new job hasn't been a job really for me.  i just sit on my butt staring at my computer screen, but today no one was at the office, so i ended up watching movies on my computer.  but i'll be working for real tomorrow, so don't hate.    regarding tears of the sun, it's supposed to be bruce willis' best action movie since the die hards.  but i dunno.	m
"It is possible both to burn with personal shame and rage at the fools Abu Ghraib, who threw away so much for so little, and at the same time to remind other people to keep  the reaction to  their criminal folly in perspective. The incident itself is one thing; the way it has been received around the world is another. Here's a good example of perspective, by a voice from the Middle East that is no American lackey:   Absolutes are appealing, but in imposing them, moralists must consider two points: That only a system which responds to censure through amelioration can eventually set lawful standards of behavior; and that some of Washington's more zealous Middle Eastern critics often avoided applying a universal ethical yardstick when considering what took place under Saddam - even as the US today accepts their moral privilege to condemn its actions in Abu Ghraib.  There is no justification (let alone a politically expedient rationale) for a host of recent American undertakings in Iraq - whether the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners or the bombardment of civilians in Falluja. However, there is also no excuse for denying that what we have seen in the past week in the US has been the thrashing about of a democratic system that feels disgraced by the behavior of several of its citizens, and that intends to rectify matters.   The Egyptian playwright Ali Salem told me recently that the true indignity of the Iraq war was that it was not Arabs who had overthrown Saddam Hussein. He was right. As Arabs examine the photographs from Abu Ghraib and read about American misconduct there, they might reflect less on what this says about the US, which usually ponders its worst excesses, than what it says about their own systems, where such images could only have been glimpsed over the carcass of an overthrown regime.    urlLink  Abu Ghraib, or how to lose some perspective on a very foul affair,   in the (Lebanon) ""Daily Star."""	m

The nice thing about being single is that you don't have to diet. I can eat whatever the fuck I want, and who cares if I get fat.  Oh, and you can also mindlessly flirt with as many men as you want, and they aren't afraid of flirting back. (They barely speak to you when you're married, and that always sucked.)   I should also remember that I probably fluked it with Richard. Most men are not that nice.  A wonderful friend of mine is mailing me a porn movie while the folks are away. (I won't mention his name in case someone is reading this who shouldn't be.)   Porn is good. That's how people stay single, right?  It certainly isn't the cats!!!	f

Another day down, one day closer to the end of the year and the beginning of a month on the roads of America.  Unfortunately, every day down is also another day closer to moving out of my place in Manchester... something I am definitely not looking forward to.  I've felt like crap for the past two days upon departure from school.  I chalk it up to a nasty combination of lack of sleep, poor eating schedule, and carpet mold in my classroom.  Fortunately, after a salad and some chicken, I am feeling much better and ready for yet another day tomorrow.  So many things to take care of before I move out on the 12th, and before I leave for New Orleans on the 18th.  Packing is the most pressing concern.  Anyone have boxes I could get my hands on?

"i was thinking about trying out livejournal... so i went to go make an account, right? but its stupid and wont let me do it for some reason. for one thing, it says your password has to be a dictionary word. thats unfair. a password is harder to guess if it isnt a word. and i use the same password for a lot of things. and it isnt a word. so i have to pick a new one. i do. apparently its not a word. i cant find any password that are words. apple isnt a word. oh, and it doesnt want to let me use ""yellowfuzz13"" as my name because its over 15 characters and contains letters that arent a-z and it contains numbers that arent 0-9. right. i gave up. obviously God does not want me to have a livejournal.  i should really be doing my homework. but im lazy and i dont feel like it. so...im not.  emily got her license yesterday. yay for emily.  might  drive over to see me today for a few minutes. ""we'll see."" dont know if thats more of a maybe or a no. but, hey, it is on the way home from lauries. (and why is laurie so special? no...dont want to ask that...probably no reason. im just paranoid.) so that could be a nice break from homework. im hoping for it, though i dont know how likely it is.   i ordered girl scout cookies from heather today. apparently all together my family has ordered 15 boxes. 15! seems like a lot. i guess theyll go quickly, though. have ordered from heather, michele, and my moms pto friend's daughter. irked me when michele said something innocently enough but with an impied statement of ""you only bought cookies from heather last year, dont forget im selling them too. youre my friend too. my neighbor too. its not fair."" blah blah blah... of course shes not that mean, but i know she meant to make me feel guilty or something. in an innocent sort of way. bah! human interaction. crazy. reminds me of that thing on julies profile:  Why do we speak in songs?  she asked, and my only response was to shrug and remind her that often it is easier to take words from others, let others speak that which is in our hearts.  But who is willing to bend his emotions to those of someone else? she asked.  All of us and none of us, I said.  We wish for people to read between the lines.  Subtext, she exclaimed.  In a way, I said.  Those who care about you are supposed to know what's written on your heart.  interesting, no? [sadness alert] mmm, but... what if, try as you may, you dont know everything about those you care about? and its hard to read their heart? not for lack of trying... sigh. i wish i was better at knowing what people really mean when they say things. or what they really mean when they do things. what they truly feel and think. and ive taken to just asking sometimes. but hten i get ""i dunnos"" which is bad cause, hell, what else am i supposed to do if you wont tell me and i cant figure it out myself? but then again, maybe im just trying to read into things too much and theres really nothing of any significance thought and felt but unsaid. in which case we can just conclude that i worry too much and should calm down and enjoy life and what happiness it gives me instead of making myself unhappy thinking about the happiness it wont give me and how much i want it. or something. i dont know. you can word that differently so that it sounds like either side is a good option. i could say what i just said, which makes it sound like im crazy for killing myself over something i should just forget about. or i could something to the effect of its crazy for me to give up and stop trying to acheive something i want so much, so...passionately, because just the fact that i want to keep trying is worth something, and i know i could give up and make life easier, but i dont want to because its so important to me, and isnt that sort of honorable? to sacrifice happiness for...ideals? sort of? or something? you know what i mean? yeah. i know exactly what i mean...  ""Big Balls"" by ACDC is a good song. funny. now thats one long double entendre.  i think ive decided for certain that im not goign to turnabout. for myriad reasons. and there is, in fact, heatherandmichele weirdness as i suspected there would be. which, before anything else, makes me feel bad for emily. who shouldnt have to deal with that. emily who just wanted people to go with her and eric to turnabout. maybe it wont be a big deal and no one will get mad or anything. thatd be nice. but thast one of the reasons i didnt want to go. i dont want to deal with that. because even if it doesnt bother emily, itd bother me. me who worries too much.       and then there are a million other reasons why i dont want to go. well, as i told martha who is/has been bothering me about this. (and is a (if not  the ) source of the michele problems...which annoys me)  martha:  kara:  just because she doesn't have a date doesn't mean she can't come...we can just have some extras...a lot of groups have that me: i know that. i just...the reasons for going arent tipping the scale when i try to weigh them with the reasons for not going martha: :-( me: and this michele thing...doesnt motivate me. Martha: what would motivate u?? me: i dont know me: if i had a guy i wanted to go with...who wanted to go wtih me... and if i would get to talk to emily lots without awkward eric-ness... and if i didnt have to deal with anit-michele (and heather) weirdness... and if i didnt have to dislike any band friends...and if caitlin was going... and if jessica was going... and if i had a dress i wanted to wear...and... if all the guys we were going with got along well... and... i dont know. stuff. me: probably more. Martha: ya me: if you can solve all of those problems for me, id probably go. me: but good luck with that.  those are some of the reasons i dont want to go. yes, some of them are vague. some actually less vague than i originally intented them to be. but thats why i dont want to go in a nutshell. two main reasons: 1. no guy. 2. although i may see emily, i dont think it will be a comforting ""yay, we ARE good and happy friends! why do i worry?"" kind of thing. i fear it may be the reverse, which is to be avoided at all costs if i value my sanity. and maybe that makes me a coward or means im avoiding the problem, or something. but oh well. maybe it means nothign and there is no problem and im just worrying too much. maybe thats it!  or maybe im crazy and paranoid and need medication or something. always a possibility...  though ive always thought i wouldnt want medication if they gave me medication to make me sane. i dont trust people screwing with my thoughts and my emotions and my reality. its all i have that no one can take away from me. and its all that is me, really. they cant mess with who i am. never.  mm, arguing morality with martha again. reminicent of the ""love"" conversation. mmm, never should have started that one... although... all this anti-michele business from the girl who said money can buy love. i dont get her. shes a good kid, i know it...but...i just dont completely get her. i wonder if i still get emily? mmm, i hope so. maybe i can again.  i tried making an omlette for breakfast/lunch. it came out kinda badly. tasted okay but it was a little too liquidy for my tastes. i always have that problem with omlettes...the inside part doestn cook all the way through. oh, and another problem i have is putting what physically are too many ingredients...though as far as taste goes, its usually dead on. crazy omlettles. my hand still smell like onions.  i think maybe ive been thinking too much today...maybe its a sign that i shouldnt give myself so much free time. though its good to think, right? sure...  ooh, now this conversation is deep. im probably making her sad and confused, actually. at least i hope im not. criticizing her philosophy on life...her lack of motivation for trying...and wondering if this is because she doesnt have a good reason for living...you know how everyone needs something to work towards to get up in the mroning? to make the bad days worth it? all taht....yeah... thats what were talking about now. depressing if youre just realizing these things and they shock you...which i dont think im doing to her, but...well, lets hope not. eh, i dont think i am. martha: u said the if u have nothing to work towards then ur life isnt fulfilling...so why does it have to be fulfilling??  sigh... some people i just dont get.   i feel like chinese food. i need to do my homework. i need to listen to some cool music. ive been blogging too long. i wish emily checked her email more often and actually sent me more email. that would make me happier. among other things. i wonder how it feels to know simple things like that...or just your actions in general affect another persons mood so profoudnly. i wonder if its overwhelming. i wonder if she even realizes it.  i decide today that i really want to be able to make people feel guilty. i want to know how to word things so delicately that they sound like an innocent comment but really they kindle a fire of guilt in the back of the mind...and then you drop little comments here and there...and the fire grows...and grows...and... maybe its cruel...it probably is. but sometimes i just want people to know how they should feel. like, dammit, that hurt, you dont feel guilty but you should! you know? ah, i dunno. i shouldnt wish things like this.  i wish...*closes eyes*... i wish...if you know me well at all, you know what i just wished for.  ha...and if you dont know me: its not a guy, its not money, its not my license, its not a grade, its not...anything matieral or stupid.  although...as someone wise once said, ""i wish: for trivial things, i pray for everything else"" or something like that. right? perhaps i shouldnt wish for something so important.  im going to get a cookie.  by the way, who all is reading my blog now? should i stop talking about emily? originally no one read this at all and i didnt talk about people or school...just...ideas. but now its more of a real blog for me. and apparently several people read it now...and jessica i dont care about so much cause she knows me and the people i tend to talk about well enough not to take anything the wrong way or anything. not that i dont trust my other friends who raed this, but... bah. i dunno. dont go crazy or think me insane over things i write. or think the people i write about are insane. or something. wow, i could have written this much more eloquently if i had more time and wasnt as distracted. oh well. basically: some of this is my private life you wouldnt normally hear about, i dont always freely tell anyone everything written on my heart, and maybe theres a reason for that. so keep that in mind while reading."	f
"Wow, what a week it's been!  On Tuesday, Tish from HR drove Ben and I around to look at houses.  I was really sick that day and had thrown up that morning (no, I'm not pregnant, but my entire gastronomic system is very unhappy with the new food I'm shoving into it and my bizarre sleep schedule) but I really wanted to go out and look at homes so I stuck it out.  We wanted to get something in the area so that Ben could walk to work if possible (the bus is pretty expensive) so we drove around for ahwile, looking at places with For Let signs up and writing down their phone numbers.  We then drove over to Belvoir Lettings and told them what we were looking for - 2 bedrooms, ÂŁ550 a month or less, furnished, and oh yeah, we have a menagerie of animals we'd like to bring with us.  Well, that last part just didn't fly.  Probably about 90% of the lettings are ""no pets"", 9% are ""pets negotiable"", and 1% is ""bring on your lovely pets!""  We are so used to the Northwest where everyone has pets and if one rental won't take them, the one right next door will.  The guy at Belvoir also told us that ""pets negotiable"" usually means ""one cat negotiable"" and that it would be hard to find a place for our puppy Pip.  He came up with a place that doesn't accept pets but was very close to Ben's work, so we went to the open house at 1:00pm that day.  It was very cute, 2 bedrooms, fully furnished (with Ikea-style furnishings, the man made sure to tell us several times), and has a nice big backyard with a fruit tree!  And a washer and dryer!  There were three other people looking at it at the same time, so when we got back to the car, we decided to try to get it!  It was the first place we looked at, but we figured we liked it so why not.  We raced back to Ben's office and called Belvoir Lettings, and we were the first ones, so we paid our application fee (usually around $30 in the US - ÂŁ179 IN THE UK!!!) and our deposit and I think we're good to go.  We had to turn in applications, so I don't know if they are going to do a credit check or what, so we'll have to see, but I think we got the place!  And how's this for coincidence - one of Ben's housemates just moved into a new room and his old room is free, with its closet and DOUBLE BED, till July 17th.  We can move into our new house on... you guessed it!  July 17th!  But I don't believe in coincidence, I believe God is blessing us!  Woo hoo!  So we have slept much nicer the last couple nights.  I love the man but I can only take so many elbows in my side all night. We will have a six-month lease there, which is how long it will be until my puppy and kitties can come over.  At that point in time, we will hope either the landlord has had a major change of heart and is willing to let our pets come live with us, or we'll move.  Luckily, since it's fully furnished, it won't be too big of a deal to move.  And at least this will give us time to find a good place that will take pets and not grab the first thing we see.  We are considering, though, not bringing our kitties over... it is so stressful on them to fly and move to yet another new house, and it might be better for them to just wait for us in the States.  Pip would adjust much more easily to the new place and the flight, I think.  So that's something we're thinking about.  Plus, it will be a lot easier to convince someone to take one puppy than one puppy and two kitties.  We'll see.  Sad. :(  I saw a commercial for cat food last night that had a big fluffy gray kitty on it, and it looked so much like my Koshka that I burst into tears. :(  I miss my babies!!!  I've been dreaming about Pip pretty much every night. In other news, I've got a job interview on Monday at 11:00am, YIKES!  I'm super nervous about it. I haven't interviewed in so long!  (Except for MFT, but that was different than a job.  That was a life passion.  This is, ""Hey, I want to work in your office!"").  After the interview, they give you a ""psychometric exam"" to assess your personality (Myers Briggs?) and a math and english exam (to make sure you're not stupid).  I AM stupid in math, so I hope I don't totally and completely embarass myself.  Ben slid by all that since he got transferred from the US, lucky guy.  The job is for the coordinator of the learning center, which sounds really cool!  They also have an opening for a personal assistant to some lady, which they are also interviewing me for, but I'm not as thrilled about that one.  But I'm sure any job would be great!  They think I can piggyback on Ben's work permit, so I hope that's the case!  I was actually hoping I could be a bar wench or something like that, that I'd probably never do in the States, but if this is what God wants to drop into my lap, I'm not arguing.  Like literally, I didn't even seek this out.  They approached me and the next thing I knew I had an interview set up!  The HR lady told me that this is the time of year when a lot of people are getting out of school with their new qualifications and are applying for jobs, so there will probably be a lot of competition, so I'm not getting my hopes up too high.  We shall see!   So, to add to the blunder list: Wednesday I went to Belvoir Lettings to turn in Ben and I's applications.  As I sat down, I got this cough in my throat.  Every time I tried to talk, I coughed.  I had tears streaming down my face, and the handsome fellow at the desk didn't quite know what to do with me.  I got my voice back, and then he asked me a question, and I started coughing again.  It looked like I was trying to cover something up or something.  Wednesday, I decided to wash my hair in the sink.  They have a hot spigot and a cold spigot.  The hot got REALLY hot REALLY fast, so I had to wash my hair under the freezing cold spigot.  Then, the sink is super tiny, so I discovered that once I started using only the cold side, I couldn't fit the left side of my head under the spigot to get the soap out!!  So I was getting total brain freeze trying to make my head become a contortionist and scoop water over to get the soap out.  It was a lovely morning. :D  Then, today, I came in here to Ben's work to the Learning Center to use their computers to e-mail.  Just as I got here, I saw the HR lady that I met with Wednesday, and who will be interviewing me on Monday.  We chatted for awhile, and as she stood to leave, I said, ""Thanks, Elizabeth!""  Then I stared in utter horror at her back as she walked away, because her name is CATHERINE!!!  I have no idea where I got Elizabeth. :(  She didn't react or say anything.  Argh!!!  Another great impression I made!  ""Hire me, I forget who I'm talking to in the middle of a conversation!"" This upcoming weekend we are going to play tourist and visit the castle and Sherwood Forest and all that good stuff.  Can't wait!"	f
last night i was home alone between 7 and 9:00pm. and when i'm bored i feel like doing something to liven things up. my choice: drinking wheee! so i get out my moms red whine and drink...i dont know how much but a lot was consumed cause i just chugged and to my knowledge whine contains a pretty good sum of alcohol. well i wanted more stuff to make me actually feel it so i got out some liquor and drank a lot of that too... and by the time i was done i was sooooo dizzy!!! my parents came home at 9:30 or something so i went to my room and just kinda walked around in circles but it was the most fun ever cause i was falling all over the place and getting back up then falling again. and i tried to walk in a strate line and it was not possible! eventually i layed down and fell asleep and now i am on day 2 of my grounding.  i woke up and looked at myself and noticed that i am really skinny. i weighed myself and i am now 109. !!! i used to be 113 or around there and a couple pounds is a lot to little lori. so i made spaghetti. while the rest of the world is going anti-carb i am going carb crazy today. i told my dad my plan to eat till i am 120 pounds cause that is my goal-weight. ok--so then i vacuumed the 1st floor for 5 dollars and it is now close to 3:30 and i have nothing to do for the rest of the day.	f
With a little effort today I'll finish editing chapter 11. I could have finished last night before I went to bed but I misspelled every other word and it was already two in the morning. I made some notes then crawled in bed. I didn't meet my goal of having the first edit finished by today and I haven't set a new goal yet.  I read  Blind Side  by Catherine Coulter and  Saving Dr. Ryan  by Karen Templeton this week. The latest book in Coulter's FBI series was a disappointment. I have read all the other  urlLink books in the series  except  The Edge  and enjoyed them but this time was different. I kept getting lost while reading  Blind Side  and had to re-read sections.   Saving Dr. Ryan  is a Silhouette Intimate Moments novel about a country doctor and a young widow with three children who are unbelievably well-behaved. I liked the premise but there were things about the story that bothered me. For example, at one point in the story there's a comment about the woman being too young to have three children. The woman was married before having any of her children so I didn't understand why the age was so important. I remember rolling my eyes and thinking we now know how the author feels about young mothers. The mother in the story is 24, only a year younger than I was when I gave birth to my 3rd child. It's entirely possible that sentence bothered me on a personal level.	f

My schedule right now is still up in the air. Things seem to constantly be changing. It doesn't help that the Korean teacher I co-teach elementary with is newer than I am, and that the Kindergarten program is only a month older. Or that no foreign teacher has ever worked here, and the program is a lot more conducive to translation, which I don't really do efficiently. The books I use for the elementary kids completely suck. And when I suggested using different ones, they didn't really like it. Sometimes people run up to me to say that I've got a class with a pack of middle school kids that started ten minutes ago, but I didn't know because no one bothered to tell me. So sorry. And that they have no text book. I can't say I'm a fantastic teacher, but I've become pretty adept in the past three weeks at throwing together a lesson that requires not much more than a white board, markers, and a blank sheet of paper and pen for each student.  When I agreed to teach at this school, I was expecting disorganization and communication problems and things like being told I have a class five minutes ago. The reason I signed on was because the pay was pretty decent, and the schedule is Monday to Thursday. I have no Friday classes, so every weekend is a long weekend, and this weekend was potentially extra long.  Tomorrow is election day in Korea. It is a national holiday. I get all national holidays off. Ergo, I get Thursday off. Yes? Actually, no. My two evening middle school classes are still on as per usual. Good bye long weekend.  Today, in between classes (one ends at 6, the other starts at 6) my Korean co teacher tried to explain to me that I have to come on Friday as well. Excuse me? It seems that one of my middle school students is doing some sort of test or competition thing on the internet, and I have to hold her hand while she does it. I mentioned to my partner that this seemed unnecessary and a little unfair and like cheating. She promptly communicated this information to the director, who said that, well, its okay, because everyone will be doing it. Far be it from me to interfere with Korean tradition.  So, it seems not only is my weekend not extra long, it isn't long at all. I'm not really angry about it though. It's not like I have a brisk social life happening, and it won't take much time. And I wouldn't argue even if I was angry, not in my first few weeks, not before I've even been paid. I believe you have to give a little to get a little, and I can't always expect everything to run according to my supposed schedule. It would be a little nasty to get pissed because I've gotta spend what'll come down to probably less than a half hour that I basically only have to show up for. For all that it sometimes seems ESL teaching in Korea is just a different kind of McJob, I get a salary, not an hourly wage. It's more responsibility than just showing up for my shift every day. Though sometimes not much more.  This better not set any kind of a precedent, though. I signed up in good faith for a position that was Mon-Thu. If they start scheduling classes for me on Friday, then I'll be pissed.	f
Woooooooowwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee did I have fun today! We got so near the front you could practically see the sweat dripping off Busted, Misteeq and those strange Big Brova people in VERY small dresses. Hey ho, I really enjoyed it, even if one side of my face is bright red from being in the sun all day. Hey ho, that's the price you pay for entertainment i guess, by the beeb's standards. But yes twas good. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Very nice seeing you Tom and Nicki! I have to meet Jenny, she sounds lovelly. Sounds perfect girlfriend material. Tom. *wink wink* *nudge nudge*	f

""" There is no such thing as a man willing to be honest. That would be like a blind man willing to see "" --F. Scott Fitzgerald     There are a lot of problems with being a ‘nice guy’. The number one problem is that nobody tells you anything. Everyone has this huge problem because they think it will “hurt your feelings” and it really is a problem. Everybody else knows everything before you, other people are let in on secrets and you can never really know somebody.   People hide things from you when you’re a ‘nice guy’, and I guess I can’t blame them. When you tell nice people about your problems, you can only expect one reply. Something along the lines of “oh, no” or “that’s too bad”. People go to honest people when they have problems, because they’ll get honest feedback. That’s what people need.   The big thing about honest feedback is that nobody likes it, yet everybody wants it. It’s a very tough thing to take. To use an example; if you like a girl and she doesn’t like you back, would you rather she said “no” straight off, or ‘pity date’ you until she can take it no more? The answer I’d take is the honest no, I don’t know about any of you.     There is a big difference between honest and nice. The word nice, to me, is such a plastic word. It’s very sweet on the tongue, and it’s not a negative comment, but I would much rather be called honest. It’s much more of a compliment.   Nice is when people will lie to you at all times as long as you feel good. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a bad thing in small doses, but when something like the above situation occurs, the lie becomes more painful then the truth (strangely enough!).   Honest people know when the time has come to be honest. These people are very hard to find. I myself have found a few, but they wouldn’t want their names on the internet. These people put others before themselves, not to be noticed or to be remembered as “the guy who was good enough to do that” but just because it is what they do.     These people are always there, and always tell you what you need to hear. Whether it is a white lie to motivate you to try harder, or the harsh truth to stop you from doing the wrong thing. These people have risen above these standard human, and should be commended, because that is a tough thing to do in a society like ours, where the different are outcast (in most cases).  But these people live up to their names, they are honest. They don’t like the limelight, and would rather do their job quietly then draw attention. These unsung heroes shy away from the glare of publicity, because they know that good deeds feel good because they are good, not because of the reward.  They aren’t all people working for the Salvos, or St Vincent de Paul (though that in itself is commendable) but most of these people do it unconsciously, not knowing that they are good people.     I call these people Angels.     I really do believe in the angel theory. There are some people on this earth that I think are (unknown to them) spiritually superior. Sent by God? It depends, but wherever they come from it doesn’t matter. These angels are the guardians of the Earth, the universes way of holding us together, the glue of the human psyche.     Look at us, the human race. We are a beautiful representation of the balance of good and evil. We all have the potential to go either way. Inside us we have anger and hate, balanced with calm and love. Most of us grow going neither way, because of the choices we make we end up in the middle, living in “sin” but also doing good things for ourselves and others.   With balance comes the obvious need for unbalance, and this can occur with the “end of the scales” evil people. We hear of them all the time; Hitler, Saddam, Stalin, Himmler, Osama, the Klu Klux Klan, wife beaters, child rapists, murderers, the list is endless! Evil itself is the opposite of good, and therefore, these evil people crave the media and the limelight as much as our ‘angels’ repel it. A big factor of evil is fear, and nothing spreads fear like evil.  Now, with the scale of life weighted down by evil, good needs to be created to balance the scale again. Angels are created, people so pure of heart and honest of mind that it is incomprehensible to us. While these good people do not look for the media, it sometimes finds them, because everyone loves a “nice” story. People like Jesus, Mother Teresa, Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther king; all these people humble us, the seem almost inhuman with what they have done.    There are millions of angels that we never remember, the dedicated fireman, the person who gives up his seat on the bus for the old man, the loving father/mother, the missionary, the friend that would rather get you angry at him then let you come to harm.    Which of course brings us back to the starting the point. Because in the end, angels would sacrifice themselves for others (even in something as small as a conversation at school) then let others come to harm.   Everyone knows angels in their lifetime, and we all have the potential to become one. Think about it, could you be an angel to somebody? Are you? Are you an evil person to some people?   Angels are the walls that were made to be leant on, but without them the house comes crashing down. Evil is the crack in the roof that lets the rain in, but without it, nothing would ever be fixed or changed.    The universe is perfectly balanced, and always will be."	m
Well tonight was a bone-a-fied blast and half. It was Robins sweet 16, and I dunno about everyone else but I had a great time. It was like straight dancin and eatin and drinkin (soda and shirley temples lol). One of the DJs (did you ever notice after a sweet 16 there is always a DJ story? lol) was all up on Melissa, Debra, and Me a little bit. It was mad funny, he said I had the best milkshake (I was dancin to it and he said this one thing I did was the best or something). I had a great time, and I wore the hat Deb got me for Christmas. The DJ was callin me J. Lo and tellin me he wanted my hat. I was like, um I'm not J. Lo and you can't have my hat... biotch!!! Well, I didn't say biotch, it just kinda fit in w/ the sentence lol. So... yea... thats about all thats goin on... tomrrow I dunno what imma do. Probably start my Chem review sheet or something. How sad and pathetic am I? Well, night x0x	f
"Talk about hostility...  Yesterday, b had four of his friends come over to play outside...it was pretty funny.  at first, b was trying to run around to get his toys that they were playing with.  after the 100th time of telling him that if he didn't share he would have to have a time out, he resolved that he would just have to make sure they new the toys were his...so he went around ""mommy that's my truck""  ""mommy that's my car""...to which i kept saying ""yes that's your XXX, isn't it fun sharing with XXX?""  i don't think he was convinced this was fun!  But it was so cute to watch a bunch of 21/2 year olds who are only children play but never really play together...they all had their own thing going on and occassionally they would acknowledge each other...like by splashing each other or trying to swipe a toy.  Hubby and I made nice I guess...I decided, be upset or forgive...ughhh...i chose to forgive.  So, I tried to stay awake to see him but wasn't successful, so I just snuggled with him when he came to bed...hopefully, I didn't drool considering I was still pretty much asleep.  Nervous about possibility of seeing mr x tomorrow.  Hubby decided he wanted to go to the richland parade...he knows i saw Mr X last year and i am hoping the reason he wants to go isn't because he wants to hunt him down!  i don't think he would do that...especially because of his career choice, here's hoping!"	f
Holy moley, I am sitting here trying to blog, when 50 million and 2/3 conversations pop up and being the nice and courteous, uncouth, gallant, chivalrous, and otherwise not rude guy that I am, I try to answer them all so people don't feel ignored. That's always fun.    I missed Kelly's EMT thingy where she had a pretty nasty leg wound. Man, I'm disappointed! I tried to run over there, but it turned out they got done early, and she actually caught me when she was driving home. We dropped off her pics, which I saw today- very gruesome and funny!   I tried to make a blog yesterday, but the thing was down. I was just gonna write to say that I didn't want to do a blog.    I had a fun bike ride with Katie yesterday. We went everywhere and anywhere in my neghborhood and Colony Creek. We even used those dorky hand signals for when we turned! Ha ha, great stuff.   I will finish soon, cuz I need to go drop my sis off at soccer practice. Holler back, young un!   God bless	m
I got an insanely early night last night. Woke up to find my internet access shot. Apparently my modem released my ip and was unable to re-establish it. One thing is making work bearable right now, that's four hours of Star Trek back to back. Which is great even if one of the eps has to be from voyager. It's kind of like reading an author you hate, you don't enjoy it, but it's valuable from a literary criticism standpoint. Bought a CD Rack for my cd's so I can finally get rid of my stupid tilt a whirl rotate a cd holder. I may put that downstairs when I eventually get a stereo (I might buy a stereo!!)  I'm thinking of turning the corner of my bedroom into a little board game centre. Four chairs or stools that would fit under a table just the right size for some board games and drinks. I think I might build the table myself and put a chess/checkers board right into the surface. I'm going to look around and see how it's done.  That is all.	m
i'm so tired, yet i can't go to sleep, i think i have insomnia......... i can't stop thinking about her either.	f
Life.or something like it!  Heres a basic recap of my Labor Day weekend!  It started on Thursday night after work when we played a double header in my company softball team.  Ill just give you a basic gist of it..we lost both of them!  I actually didnt do so bad.but thats because I was a sub for both games.  When I did come in, I went 1 for 1 in the first game and 1 for 2 in the second game.  We are now 0 and 3 in the standings!  When I got home that night, I learned that my uncle and aunt were planning to move out of the trailer.that lies on my property of where Im building.  The plan was that I build on the spot where the trailer is but they live in it now since they are building a house for themselves.  I didnt want to push them out but they knew that I wanted to start soon.  Anyway, with the news that they were moving out over the weekend, my folks were in a rush to find out some way to get the trailer off the land.  The original plan was that my father found someone to take it to use as a hunting trailer but found another one a couple of weeks ago.  So my folks, especially my mom, who was trying to help me on this, started looking up numbers to give away the house.  I was helping her looking up numbers and all of sudden she was bitching on how we have to do this now!!!  I am just there reading the numbers in the phone book when she did this so I started shouting back feeling that she unjustly bitched at me, and all of a sudden it was a shouting match between her and I.  For those that know her, and me, we never argue about anything in way like this before so it was an unusual outbreak of emotions between the two of us.  However, we calmed down to finishing looking up numbers.  Friday, after I got off work, I came back home.  I found out my mom had called around about getting rid of the trailer but only found that would cost me $1200 to get a guy to come and take it away.  I was feeling the pressure on me at this point but it then that my mom got a call from my uncle.the same one that I bought the land from.found someone to take the trailer away for FREE!!!!  I was so relieved to hear that.    Saturday morning, I got up early to go help my uncle/aunt to pack up and move out of the trailer.  But, when we got there, they moved most of the stuff out already.  I helped though move out the fridge and some large cabinets.  They moved all their stuff into the large shop that they have below where they are building!  Now, all that I have to do is wait until they move the trailer!  After helping, I left around 3 to come back home and get dressed to go out to dinner with Loreley.  Her mom came down from Ohio for the weekend and she wanted to meet her.  I was a bit nervous about it and I dressed up for them.  However, I seemed to have been overdressed because they dressed in shorts and t-shirts and I had on my Sunday best!  I meet them at the Kroger parking lotwhere Loreley works.  It was Loreley, her mother, aunt, her grandmother, and her mothers friend and we all got into the Suburban and went to dinner at the Outback.  I actually had a good time eating out with them.  After dinner, they drove back to Kroger and I said goodbye to her mother.  I think she liked me because she hugged me before leaving.  That is a good sign right?  On Sunday, I went to church that morning.  I ran into Loreley after the early service and she was heading out with her mom to Fredericksburg.  I went to my moms cousin house to have a birthday party for my aunt and uncle, who are twins, for their 42nd birthday.  On Monday, I was off from work because it was Labor Day.  I slept in that morning but decided to go town to go see Loreley at work to ask about going out after she got off.  We decided to go for a drive to Skyline after work around 2, so I went to Lowes to check about a sample of aluminum siding for the house that I need to get to compare for bricks I was getting for the house.  I then went to Loreleys house to meet up with her.  We left around 2 and drove from Greene up to Skyline Drive.  We decided to stop and hike up Humpback rocks there but about half way up, it started to rain.  When we finally got back down, we were both drindged!  We decided to drive back to Charlottesville, where we decided to get ice cream at Kohr Bros.  I dont know if that was such a good idea since we were still cold from the rain!  We then headed back to her house where I realized that my windows in my car were down and some rain poured.  Luckily, her parents were home and put towels on which Im thankful for.  Hope everyone else had a good Labor Day!	m
"Follow Up... Ok, now that I have time...I think.... I will post.  School has been really stressful, but I will be getting a break soon, which is suuuhhweeet.

Ugh, I feel that loss of an hour. Still feel sick but am going to work. The only reviews I can provide you with are of the tv shows I saw over the weekend in a feverish state. I did catch one more bit of humor on ER involving Romano setting his arm on fire while making tea. Is it just me, or is the stuff with his arm just plain comical? It's better than a French farce. His arm burns whenever there is a fire. If M. Hume was here she would blame it on his nervosity.  I apologize in advance to the patrons of CMOM on whom I may cough, hack, and sneeze upon today. I also apologize in advance to the exhibits department...I'll try not not to get my germs on the art. If this sickness keeps up I may leave early.  Happy Passover to all my fellow Jews and Happy day after Palm Sunday to all the Gentiles!	f

"Just returned from much driving again. Had to run Mom to the airport where she was jetting off to Dallas in a spur of the moment decision to visit a friend in need after the death of one of Mom's high school classmates(who also happened to bethe friend's husband). She was on the phone with Carolyn (her friend) and Carolyn simply asked, ""Will you please come?"" Mom checked on flights and decided to go for it.      My whole family was saddened to hear of Dan's death. He was a great guy - funny, opinionated, generous and loving. RIP Waldo. We'll miss you.       After the airport I brought Dad back home, stopped in the old hometown for gas and a carwash and the streets were crowded with people visiting the Music and Arts Festival so I thought, ""Why not?"" I wandered around for a little while stopping at all of the art booths. I avoided all of the greasy food booths even though the mini-donuts smelled divine.       From there I stopped at the cemetary where I realized I hadn't visited since my grandmother's funeral 18 months ago. Dad had just been there watering flowers I noticed. He said he was heading that way. I offered but he said it would give him something to do.       Then it was off to the grocery store where I picked up everything I needed for   urlLink  this   . I'm going to make it next weekend and if it turns out okay (yes a test run), I'll make it again the following weekend for Kel's homecoming. And then we'll all drop over from the extra cholesterol. :-)      Things are starting to cool off and now that I know I have to get Keith to a dentist appointment tomorrow morning and then to his apartment instead of having the whole day for mowing, I think I might go get some of that done now. You know, if the mower works and all that.  *cough*       Gonna run today, Ker? Well, duh. Later."	f

so operation: qp is moving right along and is coming along nicely.  good good. we had a vacation bible school meeting tonight and it was a snoozefest but that's okay. i'm sure it will be fun. okay um i believe i am allergic to bananas and need to stop eating them. anyways, i drove everybody home, literally. and i had no accidents, problems, or scares. it was superb. then a bit ago i was playing guitar. and now i'm drinking a fruit smoooooooothie with banana in it and i feel allergic to it. so maybe i shouldn't. hmm..what to do.. tomorrow i might go to IKEA, the greatest swedish store ever, unless there is a swedish store where you can buy swedish men. i'm not sure about that though. anyways, i watched a small bit of the democratic convention but then my mom turned it off. currently i'm wearing my jacobs gym shorts because my laundry is being done. it makes me feel ill. so i suppose that is all for now. umm yeah.	f
"So, I have a blog? What the fuck? I always said ""I don't know what I'd write about, and I don't know who'd want to read it"". So maybe that answer will come in time, and I'll find that this is a waste. But the truth is, I know precisely what I'd write about. Whether or not anybody wants to read it is a different story entirely.  On a lighter note, I am now the Systems Administrator for a little startup company called Oregon3D (www.oregon3d.com). Thus far it's a great job, and I have a great deal to learn. There's something simply exciting about being tossed a list of techie projects and given free reign to do as you please, so long as you produce results. That's my kind of environment.  At any rate, SuSE calls, and I must answer..."	m

I need to journal what I've done else I forget  I made a scarf from my knitting book.  Book I:  The Knit Stitch.  It's the horizontal scarf.  I used homespun yarn from Walmart.  Like three different types.  It was a good first project - the yarn is WAY forgiving.  I followed the directions exactly.  Project 2 - I used the Reader's Digest beginning purse sample.  I used the left over black homespun stuff from the scarf.  I used the required needles.  I didn't follow the pattern exactly.  The yarn is forgiving and the stitches don't show up so well.  I ended up not doing the seed stitches on the sides of the back.  The cable was good, but it can't be seen. I sucked at the handles and the lining.  I kind of made my own handles - they're uneven though.  The lining was a disaster.  I used my own stuff and it's all crooked.  Oh well.  It's cute  Project 3 - my own kitting bag,  I used size 6 needles because because I wanted a tight weave.  I used all left over yarn. In fact, the navy yarn is a totally different weight so I didn't use it very much because it was totally different when I used it.	f
"stockholm syndrom... i bet you've heard about this before, dont ya? well if u dont know what does this mean, the stockhol syndrom is when you get in love of your enemies/adversaries. the reason why im telling u this, is cuz i just found out i have this syndrom. i got a crush on one of my enemies, i dont know how did this happen. i dont even know his name! lol. the thing is that we're enemies cuz he is the friend of someone im not and that friend of him and i are the worst enemies too. he was trying to kick my ass just cuz i got in trouble with one of his friends. it was all like a gang trouble. 5 against 1. anyways, to not get in trouble, all i had to do is to let the dude throw me to the ground and done, i ""lost"". im not willing to kick a 12 year old ass just cuz he was messin around. im not that much of a fag lol. so the friend of this dude who im in love with is mexican, and he might not be white, but i find him... sexy and cute and i dont know why. i'll take a pic of him soon, i'll try not to get caught while doing so. one thing i know is that i dont have any chance with him since i dont believe he is even bi or gay. right now im begginging to feel more attracted to guys than to girls. and its not like thats a bad thing to me but i hate when people makes comments. i only know the nickname of this guy, his nickname is ridiculous: ""yu-gi"". i've been told that his nickname is that cuz he likes the stupid ""yu-gi-oh!"" show. and even though i make fun of him with my friends, inside myself i feel kinda... strange, its an unnamed feeling. like i hate him but i love him. and we dont even talk or anything! but o well, its a ""platonic"" crush, cuz i'll never be able to get to him. now, there's also this other guy in the front classroom, he is one of the 7th graders lol. i used to think he was kinda... stupid but since i've been watching him and hearing stuff about him like evryone says ""he is gay"" ""he is a fag"" well i got turned on lmao. j/k but the thing is tha the isnt ugly either, and he is white heh. i'll take pics of those guys pretty soon so just wait and judge. o well my father is on the living room with my mother talkin about i dont know what but i don't really care, when i was walking thru the living room i saw him but i didnt even say hello. hope he dies today in a wreck."	m

"The Corsair's Remote Control Tour Diary   There are over  500  cable channels nowadays, so who better to give you a tour of some of the major ones? (This idea is so good my fingers are crossed that no one steals it from me  without attribution ; unfortunately, most bloggers have sticky fingers)    Anyhoo:  500 channels means ""niche marketing."" And with all those niches, things can get confusing as to what is being marketed. So,  The Corsair  will help the viewer through the wonderful world of cable with these pithy explanations,  In Media Res:    TNT : Lousy with Middle aged  Testosterone. A musky-smelling channel.  Bruce Willis  and  Steven Seagal  action flics and basketball. Big in New Jersey.   CNN : Used to be a channel for Kings and Queens and heads of state, but of late it is the channel for cranky retired people with an angry opinion on everything political (""Those libs are holding up Medicaid!""). Poor CNN:  They used to wine and dine with kings and queens, but now they are laying in the gutter eating pork and beans.    Lifetime : A channel earnestly devoted to the smouldering resentments of Midwestern housewives. Husbands are to blame in most of these story lines. Anger is the predominant emotion. Hollywood has not been kind to  Nancy McKeon . Hell hath no fury like  Joanna Kearns  scorned!   Family Channel : The channel devoted to Christians in a nuclear family with a conviction that human history has a purpose beyond this world.  Halleleuia . Lots of  Mary Kate and Ashley films , which, ironically, attract a  very different  sort of crowd than the ones that these cats are aiming after.   CNBC : This channel serves as ""White Noise"" for the various strip joints in the Wall Street and financial district vicinity. As your  Bud Fox -like trader with a ""Lawng Island"" accent sips a  Stoli  on the rocks on his lunchbreak, sniffing his ""Bolivian white Powder"" (""Vitamin C""), getting a ""friction dance"" from his favorite ""dancer,"" he can look over her shoulder, casually, and catch a brief glance at just how the markets are doing, and get a gauge on when he should return to the office.   A : An elderly folks network with lots of  Murder, She Wrote , and ""original"" films like ""Horatio Hornblower,"" for viewers who can remember their glorious years of service in the British Imperial navy policing those hectic colonial ports.   History : This is the  Hitler  and  Outlaw Biker  channel. At any time of the day, there is a  hilbilly bar with serious discussions going on as to Hitler's ""tactical blunders"" and what they would have done ""different,"" with this channel serving as the background noise.   Discovery : This is the older, skeevier companion network to the already low rent  History Channel , which means that it attracts a  comparatively downscale sort of viewer  than one would expect at History, which is not saying much at all. Seriously, though, This is the  straight up  serial killers network. No joking, yo. Somewhere in the Yosemite Valley there is a man, in a dungeon, sweating profusely, wearing clown makeup and laughing at the moon. He is surrounded by dog collars and he is described by co workers at the post office as ""a solitary man.""  Guess which channel this guy is watching to drown out the screams. That's right (sotto voce)  Discovery . Homeland security  must needs  to monitor anyone who watches  more than 3 hours a day of this shit .   VH1 : Perhaps the coolest channel on basic cable or otherwise, my little pomegranates! Suffused with irony, snark and nostalgia, this channel supplies the basic components of the Gen X diet.  Michael Hirschorn  is our god;  we are not worthy .   MTV : No longer cool: a  little  resentful of the joie de vivre its older, more successful brother,  VH1 . It will never be the  80s  again and the blush has wore off that ordinary looking frat boy  Carson Daly . No one over 16 should be watching this channel, even for the misguided purpose of irony.   E!:  Creepy celebrity stalking and gossip. Everyone on this channel reeks of thwarted Hollywood ambitions and plastic surgery gone awry. This channel hasn't had a hit since  Gregg Kinnear   was up in this bitch , and  Jules Asner  snatched  Steven Soderberg , using the Asner name (she divorced  Ed Asner's  son years ago).   ESPN:  This is reality tv for the Maxim set. Faint but palpable homoerotic subtext via ""hero worship"" of alpha males, like, say,  Shaq  or  Sprewell  (but viewers call him Spree, cause, like, they know him personally in a  Calvin Klein  kind of way), although your average  Joe Fratboy  will never acknowledge that distrubing little truth.   Bravo : For the affluent gay man. Cultural programming( National Dog Show ,  Cirque du Soleil ,  Inside the Actors Studio )  and  Queer Eye For the Straight Guy  rebroadcasts. If you go in for the National Dog Show, collect  Lalique  crystal ("" Steuben Glass  is for amateurs""), or the like, then this is your network.   BET : A seriously embarassing network marketed to the seedy stereotype of the urban underclass. Ghetto comedy skits told in unremarkable english with frequent reference to bodily functions;  charmed , I'm sure. Snakeoil selling televangelists prevail over the airwaves on Sundays. And C-List Blaxploitations flix fill out the rest of any regrettable week spent watching this schedule.  urlLink Can you fucking believe that Viacom paid three billion dollars for this channel ?   Sci Fi:  The repressed sexuality channel. Their niche is the grown man who has a crush on the X Man,  Storm  and dreams in full-on video games. Somehow the unresolved ""sexual energy"" gets worked out into a reverence for the ""paranormal."" B List hot chicks like  Shannen Doherty  and  Tracy Lords  end up here after Hollywood is through with them.   Fox:  If you go in for  Karl Rove's  talking points, this is the channel for you.  The Corsair  has to admit that he watched it during the  Second Gulf War . Fox routinely scooped the other networks because it sometimes seemed that Rummy gave them the inside scoop. For a ""family values network,"" the women broadcasters have an  oddly pornographic patina  about them. Hmmm.   Showtime:   Tries earnestly to out-extreme the original programming at  HBO , who got there first. Dreams of getting recognized at events like the  Golden Globes ; not likely, however. This is the place to try to pitch your indie documentary on transexual underwater basket weavers in  Micronesia .   Food : For people who's interest in food has transcended the purely phenomenal eating stage.    TLC:  This channel is a bit of a mystery to me. It used to have a niche as a sort of  Cliff Clavin  channel: you know, for the general interest trivia mind-- programming on the  imago  stage of child development, poisonous reptiles, the  Minoan  civilization,  Roman  mosaics, classical biological warfare, the robber barons, volcanoes, that sort of thing. But now it has a lot of ""fixing up the home"" programming. Go figure what that means.   AMC:  Kind of Cool. Old Hollywood glamour with some original programming and commentary on the Gilded Age of Hollywood. This is like a channel put together by the editors of Variety looking backward. Vanity Fair should do a show here. Old school.   FX:  Not worth talking about. Maxim lite. Loads of testosterone.   We:  Women's fantasy. Lots of  Merchant-Ivory  Brit productions of aristocrats who fall in love with common women, who are often middle aged American divorcees. Pure drivel.   C-Span:  For the ultra political science geek. Viewers tend to look like  urlLink Michael Barone , wait anxiously for their  New Republic  copies to arrive, and chuckle over Senate voting record statistics. Can rattle off the precise wording of the Republican Party platform of 1964.   Oxy:  Very ""sisterhood"" oriented;  Oprah  and  Gerry Laybourne's  experiment has recently taken a sort of Sapphic detour of late with regard to their programming.   National Geographic:   Interesting and kind of cool. This is a channel about animals and exotic cultures.   IFC:   So earnest, so hip, so anti-Hollywood: yet as soon as  Dinner for Five's  indy star  John Favreau  gets to do a big shlocky Hollywood film like  Elf , he jumps like a Cocker Spaniel being offered a dog yummy. Independent cinema is dead.   TCM:  This is a less hip AMC. This is like AMC with a broken hip. Lots of old movies with no irony or relevant commentary.   Ovation:   The Corsair  has a theory that this is a piece of flotsam adrift on the vast media ocean that is digital television. They repeat the same ten or so programs ad nauseum. Is there anyone employed at Ovation? Did the programmer have a heart attack in the 80s? Did anyone notice? Is anyone watching?   ESPNClassic:  Oh, dear lord help us. Old men with beer bellies reliving ""classic sports moments."" (At this point,  Bruce Springsteen's   Glory Days  should be playing). This is the tv channel  Al Bundy  would most likely be watching on his day off from the shoe store.   TVLand:   Tries to be all retro-ironical, but street cred will not be forthcoming by running repeats of  Bewitched  and  Sanford and Son , alone. Poor saps. The other networks have bought all the good old tv shows, leaving TV Land to contemplate Mayberry.    Animal:  Television for committed vegans and PETA members. What kind of ad revenue do these guys generate?   Sundance:   An edgy IFC; very left wing political, but  pure .  Robert Redford's  pet liberal project.   Trio:  Perhaps the coolest channel of them all. What VH1 viewers will most likely watch once they quit being ironic, get real jobs in the media and participate in the economy. Used to be a Canadian station, believe it or not. Culture and media navel gazing.   NWI:  A rap up of all the international anti-American news agencies.  Al Gore  wants to buy this station and kick things up a notch.   DiscoveryTimes:   One of the strangest channels in the world. this is actually the  New York Times'  channel, but it is devoted to showing America militarized or in crisis, which, all told, are the moments when  The Old Grey Lady  was at its finest. Lots of Civil rights struggles, war footage, terrorism analysis, and --wierdest of all -- endless looks into our military academies.  What the fuck?!    FUSE:  MTV's unsuccessful competitor for the extreme generation low attention span kiddie market, which is not saying much.   VH1Classic:  Could be interesting, as the X Generation is big on nostalgia, but right now this channel is  not happening.    USA:  This is the sybil channel. It is high testosterone most of the year, but come holiday time it is all about the holidays... kinda like our dads.   Style:  If it is possible this is an even more shallow channel than E! Lots of B-List types talking about the beauty business.  That's all, I hope you liked my thoughts. If you did, bookmark this site.  Cordially,   Ron Mwangaguhunga"	m
"Feeling peacful. Such a warm feeling. I'm loving it. Just allowing myself to bask in the tidal wave of love and beauty undulating around me. Last night I interacted with all the loves of my life and it's made me euphoric.  Even with only four hours of sleep i'm feeling pretty rested and wonderful.  I woke up this morning with such a dynamic feeling of hope and optomism. It's so massive that it's consuming all my being, I feel like I should start handing out flowers to people or something. Life is such a wonderful lover once you let her in. She soothes and comforts you, makes you feel attractive and desirable, makes you feel like you are her one and only, and she will never let you fall. We are still in the honeymoon phase but I feel our relationship can only grow stronger. She's let me into her world, shown me a glimpse of the secrets of her passions and I hungrily await each and every opportunity to experience more of what she has to offer.  Saw the human incarnation of my desire last night. I was so overcome by emotion that it's sheer force literally left me speechless. I am so in awe of this man. I look at him and I see everything that I've ever wanted to know, everything that I've ever wanted to be. I can barely keep my insides from spilling out into a sloshing puddle at his feet. Last night, over and over again I found myself gazing at him with blatant adoration.  It's not even that I have had the chance to speak with him in depth. It's just this powerful emotion that whisks me off into oblivion the second he steps into the room.  I have never felt such a powerful rush of love for a complete stranger. I can only sit and patiently wait for my chance to bathe in the warm glow of his attention and affection.  (As I'm talking my words Slip to the floor And they crawl through your legs Slide under the back door Rendering me Freakish and dazed Well, here I am Don't know how to say this Only thing I know Is awkward silence....  -""Freakish"" - Saves the Day)  So what's next on the agenda? Not too sure. Not really looking forward to climbing off my soapbox and back into the day-to-day of this artifical reality that I find myself stuck in but I'll get through it. Jenni and Neil just got engaged on Saturday. I'm helping her get her apartment together and such so that will consume a ton of my energy over the next few weeks. I need to get cracking on my grad school timeline and start studying for the GRE's but for some reason I seem to believe the hourglass is frozen on NOW and the time for me to actually apply to schools will never come. Oh, well. Need to go. Life is leaving without me."	f

President Bush poked fun at his staff, his Democratic challenger and himself Wednesday night at a black-tie dinner where he hobnobbed with the news media.   Bush put on a slide show, calling it the ``White House Election-Year Album'' at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association 60th annual dinner, showing himself and his staff in some decidedly unflattering poses.     There was Bush looking under furniture in a fruitless, frustrating search. ``Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere,'' he said.   There was Vice President Dick Cheney, a frequent butt of gentle Bush ribbing, holding his fingers a few inches apart. Bush said, ``Whenever you ask him a question, he replies, 'Let's see what my little friend says.'''    And there was Bush again, in an odd contortion in front of his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. He said he was trying to explain to her the foreign policy of Democratic challenger John Kerry.    Bush showed himself playing cards on Air Force One and cracked that he was on his way to an international summit and using a special deck to help him bone up on the names of the leaders he was about to meet.    His slide show segued into a somber ending, showing a group of special forces troops in Afghanistan at the site where they buried a piece of the fallen World Trade Center in commemoration of the dead from Sept. 11.    The late NBC News reporter David Bloom, who died in April from an apparent blood clot while covering the Iraq war, was remembered. His wife, Melanie, talked of her husband's passion for journalism.    About 1,500 guests attended the dinner.	m
"this morning, i'm listening to  nina gordon.    her song, 2003, could have been a soundtrack to a day of my life.   ...i want to meet in 2OO3  i want to see what the future can bring to me  and when i do i'll meet you here my darling and when i'm free  i'll be waiting where i said i would be  my love will you wait for me?  what we've found is such a precious thing  that's what i 'm trying to sing ...   i met chris in 2003, waiting in the sushi restaurant where i said i would be.  i was so nervous that i think i ordered my glass of plum wine before he even showed up, just to calm my nerves a bit.  i saw him approach the door of the restaurant, and i smiled as he pushed instead of pulled.  he was being a little shy at first; i babbled to make up for it, briefly excusing myself after the main course to go pick rice out of my teeth and make sure that my hair looked decent.  i liked him right from the start, and i went home hours later feeling, for once, just happiness, and nothing else.  most first dates i'd had made me feel happy- but also a little doubtful.  not this time, buddy.  the next monday, i remember riding around in my car with dan, telling him about my date with chris.  ""do you think he'll call you?""  dan asked.  i was holding the steering wheel, in complete control, and i responded with certainty, ""yes.""  and now here we are.  i think that if there's ever a ceremony that involves me and chris, ""2003"" should play at the reception afterwards.  not that i'm actively planning any ceremonies- but, you know, you have to have a *little* foresight.  i've always liked nina gordan.   addendum:  i'm an idiot.  we met in 2002."	f
I'm an  idiot , so kill me.   I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO POST A LINK.   I forgot, okay?  The shoes,  oh my God, the shoes, you  have  to see them .  Words cannot express the love that I have for these shoes.  I just can't link the  fucking  things.  I noticed that Timmy, Bunny and Who Hymn did not offer to   save the day  .  Shame on you!   Shame ,  shame !  Vicente (now asleep in my bed) says I post  mean things  about him.  You all know it's pretty much  tongue-in-cheek , but he takes this shit literally.  Thinks the blogosphere hates him.   What.ever.   He puts up with my drama-queen-shit, he's gotta be a good guy.   V has a goddamned guitar lesson on Friday night.   We are so going to go to the  Wildflower Festival , even if it ends up being 10:00 at night when we get there!  Hey, Bun, I purchased  illegal-foot-scraping-thingie  today at Super Wal Mart.  Just about took off my left arm trying to use it.  If you see me hobbling around, with nubby toes and a stump for a foot, just remember:   Kids, don't try this at home .  So I post too often, eh  Timmy ?  I've always wanted to be compared to Robert Downey, Jr. and now,  I've  arrived  .   Non-BF  is headed for the lovely Columbus, Ohio, boil-on-the-arse-of-humanity.  Sorry Ohioans.  It's true.  He's there for three days.  Now one would think I'd be all rowdy and non-GF'ing as much as possible, right?  Not me.  I'm the loyal, devoted non-GF (what an   idiot  ).  I expect some sort of present from recent travels (he's going to Virginia next week, and I want a major supply of tobacco from that excursion).  For those of you who believe some of my posts, let me correct everyone who is misguided here:   I LOVE Vicente .  He pisses me off, he makes me irritated sometimes, I think I ought to jack-slap that bitch, but I love him very much.  I don't wanna know what he says about me, though.  Keep that to yourselves.

"*Sigh* Yesterday a friend of mine from Indonesia came to Canberra. I dont know why she would actually come here. I mean yes its great to see her but why Canberra. It came as a surprise for me since i didnt know she was coming here. The day she arrive my mum said ""you dont have plans tonight right, because we're eating dinner at a restaurant."" Being me, i love to eat food so i said, sure why not. Just before we left my mum said to wear nice clothes. But hey anything that i put on will look nice matter what, since im sooooo good-looking xD  Anyways by the time we got to the restaurant my mum mentioned that Annisa's family is coming. I was like ""what the F**K!"" why didnt she told me sooner. Maybe its just the shock of having one of my closest friends coming to Canberra, since its been 6 months since i last saw her. What i hated most from that dinner was how my sister acted towards me. Since i used to date Annisa and my sister cant get over it, and always kept mentioning how we're 'made for each other' A load of bullcrap. But the dinner went smoothly. I forgot to mention that the dinner was with a lot of the embassy workers. This is because Annisa's father is a high ranking government thingy, i dont know what he does but i know that his ranking is high. Anyways the food was great it one of those fusion restaurants with cuisines from all over the world.  After the dinner and after all the workers said goodbye and shit like that. On my way back home for some reason i cant stop thinking about how i used to feel about her. I have no idea why it happened that day, since when i last saw her in Indonesia, there was nothing....and now theres that thought. Maybe thats why the title is 'Laughable'. I guess its just one of those things ill have to learn to forget.  On the plus side since she is here i could give her the present i was going to give all my friends, if i get to see to her again before she leave and i dont have presents for all of my friends then i gotta remember to give her my red hat to christina and my old NY cap to her and maybe something for Damien"	m
I haven't posted about doping yet and I don't know if I will. Most likely, but we'll just have to wait and see. On to other things, though.  In the comments to the  urlLink entry about Vino  I linked to a CN article  urlLink explaining  why Cadel isn't racing  at the tour this year. Now, my favorite ride is Matt Wilson (who, coincidentally, is going to the tour, along with his FDJ compatriots Brad McGee and Baden Cooke) so I have a soft spot for Aussies. All of the articles I read sort of led me and the rest of the cycling world (and, as it appears, Cadel himself) to believe that he would be at the tour. So, it came as quite a surprise when  urlLink T-Mobile  released their tour team and he was conspicuously absent. My first reaction was, obviously, disbelief. But, upon learning the real  urlLink reason , I grew skeptical.   Now, I honestly have no idea if that's some BS reason to try to explain to the rest of us why they left him off, or if they really do believe they're protecting him. He hasn't fallen yet, which is better than last year. Why not let him go? I have a host of theories, none of which are probably true. But my friend  urlLink April  came up with a better one than any of mine (one of which was the idea that maybe Jan just didn't want Cadel on the team). She suggested that perhaps Cadel and Vino would have been working together for Jan, and thus, without Vino, the whole team would have to be restructured, and that would explain why Cadel was dropped. And I think she's probably right. But I just don't understand why they'd drop him when he's in good form.   Who knows? After all, we both could be wrong. Maybe they really think they're protecting him (though, they'd just have to stop him from racing to  really  protect him).   And, as I told Pam in comments on the  urlLink Matt fansite , let's hope he makes the Olympics team. Otherwise, what a waste of good form.  Either way, I'm going to be rooting for Lance (as tired of him as I may be).	f
"I think I'm going to write my essay about the EU as a reaction to WWII and the humiliation of the Marshall Plan--it helped Europe a lot, but it also forced the ""grand"" countries of Europe to see the Americans as saviors and bringers of wealth, harbingers of luxury and style. The EU is the attempt of Europe to regain some of its former cultural, economic and military supremacy. I think I have myself a thesis. Hoorah!   urlLink Europa - The European Union On-Line"	f
"So I was walking to class today and I saw the strangest thing. There was this guy riding his bike towards me and I could have sworn that it was Brendan. From a ways away all I could see was the ears sticking out and I was like ""what in the world."" I knew Brendan was at MIT but this kid looked just like him. Of course as he got close I knew the head wasn't big enough and the face was all wrong but by looking at his ears I thought ""That has to be a Wells."" I have great news for all of those concerned about my roomie situation (the 40 something Filipino wife and mother of two living in my room). Geraldine will be returning to the Philippines next Monday so hopefully I will have my own room for the rest of the semester. I will miss her some but having my own room definently outweigh the loss of such a nice person. In other news I am incredibly busy in school and I am wondering why I am here. Not really, this beats working anyday but wow are they piling it on! My spring break plans are still up in the air but I think someone is putting a bid in on my parent's house so I am thinking I should go home and throw about half my stuff away so when they move they don't have to do it for me. I don't know when I am going to make it to VA but I will sometime I promise."	f
"By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer   UNITED NATIONS - Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) has selected Pakistan's ambassador to Washington for the job of U.N. envoy to Iraq (news - web sites), replacing a top diplomat who was killed in a Baghdad bombing last year.  Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, who has served in key posts around the world, was chosen from a short-list of three candidates after extensive consultations, U.N. associate spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.   Annan has had difficulty finding someone for the job. He said last month that several candidates initially said ""yes"" but then called a week later telling him they had to say ""no"" because their families objected.   Annan intends to have Qazi based in Baghdad, but the United Nations (news - web sites) must get ""the sufficient security guarantees from both the Iraqis and from the forces on the ground ... before he can be deployed,"" Okabe said.   The other contenders were former Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haidar and former Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, she said. Like Qazi, they are Muslims.   The new U.N. special representative to Iraq will replace top U.N. envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was one of 22 people killed in the Aug. 19, 2003, bombing at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad.  -- Well...If Kofi picked him out everything must be perfectly in order. Not like Kofi has a great track record of being on top of things, although he was great during that ""Oil for Food"" program. Nothing illegal happened under his watch...nahhhhh   Andrew B."	m
So, it's the weekend... well, the weekstart =P And, I am bored. Last week was so tiring, working everyday... but, on friday, I got paid!! yay! more than I expected! hehe, it was great. But, yeh, I haven't done much this weekend... I planned on sleeping a lot... but yeah, that didn't happen. Yesterday tho, I did go out with Gerardo... cuz yeah, we didnt get to do anything on wednesday, which was our 9 month anniversary! hehe, but yeah... We went to Metro yesterday,... and then walked around Bear Creek Park... but, that's about all. And tonight, we're going out to vancouver to have dinner with my brother. But ohh! On thursday, I was just looking thru some things, and I found my friend's number, from vancouver, and decided to call her up... it's was great! I haven't talked to her ina few years.... and then she sayd that I should call up another one of my old friends... so I did... we talked for sooo long... lol.. I havent talked to her since I moved, which was like, 6 years ago... so it was good to hear her, and talk to her again. And then, because i didnt have the number, I emailed my other friend... and yes, her and I talked... so I was happy to hear from all of them, and get a chance to catch up on SOME things with them =) But anyways... there's a spider crawling on the wall in front of me... and it's scaring me, so I'm gonna get going... bye!	f
Tonight was pretty damn intense.  Class itself was a bit difficult.  Especially since I can only breathe about 40% through my nose.  Makes deep breathing during kicking a little rough.  Master Park made me kick with a 5 year old again...  I know I am supposed to teach him, but its a bit rough.  I mean, the little guy doesn't even have control over his body!  So he cant really do the kicks and he definitely cant hold the target for me.  So I just tell him to stand back and I do my thing and try to not kill him.  At least if the kid is a bit older/taller, they can hang onto the target so I can at least kick it.  Oh well.  I guess I'm just not good at teaching the little ones.  Speaking of little ones, poor Stephan is moving again.  This kid showed up at the beginning of summer from I think Minnesota or something, and now he is moving to Florida on the 25th.  Doesn't even phase him.  I don't know how a kid can do that.  But I guess if that's how you are raised, then you can deal with it.  I mean, he's 12, he cant even make friends cause he just keeps moving.  I don't think I could do that to my kids when I have 'em.  Anyways, I digress...  After class, we did another 5 movements on staff.  Getting there... Only another 50 to go...  I just cant wait until we do that and then start on the Tai Chi sword form.  That and after everything else, we learned about chi flow and such as John realigned Lark with pressure points.  Very cool.  Might get into that later, but I think I will stick to the iron body for now.  Another month, and I get to start on my arms and hands.  Takes up more time and I might need to buy some equipment so I can practice at home, but its worth it cause I already am starting to feel improvement in my legs.  Keep it up and who knows what that will do for me.  So yeah, maybe I should do some homework so I can take my stats test.  Man, I hate stats...	m
"So I'm reading on  urlLink Wired.com  right now about how Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) wants to pass a law called The  urlLink Inducing Infringement of Copyrights  Act. This law is supposed to protect copyrights by making it illegal for any technology that ""induces infringement"". It's aimed at Peer-to-Peer networks but aparently from it's vague descriptions, applies to any technology or device that allows someone to violate another's copyright. You can read more about it on Wired...    But my thoughts are this...    I think I'm getting quite sick of special interest groups managing or trying to push legislation through that protects their interest but harms the rest of Americans. If we want to keep people from doing anything illegal, I guess we should take away everything that allows people to break the law. To me that would include guns, cars, telephones, various sharp objects found around the home...     Organizations like SCO and the RIAA are really focused on copyrights and patents, basically because their whole business model revolves around them. They are not so concerned with producing new and innovative products that encourage the consumer to buy more, but are simply ready to sue anyone out of existance that comes to close to imitating them. Why do we still pay $17 for a CD at the store? I was paying that much for them when they first started to get big. I know the cost of the actual production has gone down. And why do the artists only see a small percentage of that price? Oh that's right, to keep the big fat cats in million dollar mansions in Bel Aire somehwere... I forgot...    I'm all about being a capitalist. Go supply and demand! But if people demand lower prices on CD's and you don't give it to them, yeah, you're going to start losing money. Or more appropriately put, just making less because you're ripping everyone off to start with. Don't get me started on broad reaching patents which only have the purpose of allowing companies to sue other companies that compete... Isn't competition supposed to be part of capitalizism?"	m

I'm not a rabid Harry Potter fan.  My wife is definitely a crazed fan who can zoom through the children's books as though they were a delicious Chunky Monkey pint for the mind.    I have read the first three books and will continue to read the books as more movies come out (obviously prior to seeing them because I really enjoy seeing how movie makers translate text into the visual medium).    Down to business though...  As you probably read, if you're aware of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling has released the title to the 6th book in the Harry Potter series.  You can find the article that I read about it  urlLink here.   Apparently it will be called,  Harry Potter and Half Blood Prince.     I didn't realize that J.K. Rowling had a website, but I went looking for it and quickly found it at:  urlLink http://www.jkrowling.com .  What a fantastic site for people of all ages.  I wasn't really all that impressed with the graphic design on it because I think it's just way too cluttered to really enjoy visually.  What I  REALLY  enjoyed was the level of interraction between the author and her fans.  She addresses rumors, adds little side pieces of information to enhance the world she created, she provides a pretty lengthy self-promoting sappy biography, and even a mystery.    She has a cell-phone in the upper left side of the main site, which looks like a desk incidentally.  This phone can be switched on using the power cord to the right of it and you can enter numbers into it.  I cannot figure it out...Perhaps this has some significance?  If anyone knows...drop me a note!	m
"In these days I didn't post here I've been through so many things... I felt lonely in the dark. I felt tears in my face. I felt joy in this miserable heart. I felt embarassed and unhappy because of stupid illusions. Then the idea came just like a tender feather, floating slowly through the ocean. But after all of this, I would be an idiot if I say life is a shit. Because it isn't. Life is a chance -  ""If you had one shot / One opportunity / To seize everything you ever wanted / One moment / Would you capture it / Or just let it slip?""  Even though, I'm still a little sad. I can't tell the reason. Maybe, you'll find it later."	f
First day of classes! Already swamped with things to do and remember, but other than that I think my classes are great and that my schedule will allow me to do and remember these things I am swamped with. :)  Renaissance Music with Crook is going to be intense, I think...but fun. Brandon is back! And in my class! That is excitement right there. Prof Dunne already pulled out the chair metaphor in Buddhism...but I think this class will be cool because it is much smaller and there will be more discussion and personal attention and stuff. It made me sort of giddy to be in class with him again, because he is absolutely frigging hilarious weird. I don't know if I can describe it...but damn, he's funny. He made us introduce ourselves to another class member, which I appreciated because then I didn't have to do it myself...since I didn't know anyone who was going to keep me awake? Hehe...but now I know at least one person, so it's all good.   Had a lesson with Bill...actually just the first lesson chat session, so we went over stuff I want to do this semester and what we're working on. So far so good. He gave me some good feedback on the grad schools I'm thinking about, and said he would put me in touch with the professors at UCLA and Colorado and would help me out with UA. So now I know two people who can help me in at UCLA...Sean's got connections there too, of course. I've decided I want to look into a place that has a good history program, too, because despite all my fighting it in high school, I'm realizing that I really really really love history. Especially music history. So I'm going to talk to Crook about that, too.   What else? Many things to do..I have to start thinking about new member recruitment for SAI, and planning out my recital (gotta call vince fuh), and living for next year...if we get the money soon we'll be able to get the place we want...on Carroll, four bedrooms big bathroom huge porch...so here's hoping for that. Gotta go order some music...I think I'll do that right now...hehe.	f

Who are these people who drive in the left hand land and do the speed limit? Not only that, but WHY do you do it? You people drive me nuts!!!!! There is no traffic in the right hand lane, you're going maybe 5 clicks over the speed limit and you think you've earned the right to make a home in the left hand lane? I'm doing 120 km/hr and I still stay in the right hand lane. Referring back to an earlier blog, it's common courtesy, people! WHat is it that makes you do this? Laziness? Not paying attention? One thing that I have learned in my 11 years of driving and commuting is that no matter what speed you are going, there will ALWAYS be someone driving faster than you. SO MOVE YER ASS OVER!!!! Not only that, but this left hand lane hoggers also cause a lot of the traffic problems such as congestion. You're not allowing for flow. The faster people get stuck behind you while you stay constant with the right hand laners. You're not passing, therefore causing traffic jams and the sort. STOP IT! If you see that someone is coming up behind you and is going faster, please move over. Allow us to pass.  That is all.	f
well tonight is my first entry its almost one in the morning but theres just a lil i want to say dont worry i wont bore anyone..first of all to my friend ala one of the kewlest grls i know this is how i view her really out going loving personality and just down right fun to be around...but theres also a side that i dont think she lets ppl see for ex: i think she has really low self confidence! wich she shouldnt and i dont know why she does just sometimes i see her and she looks so down like she wants to change her self...but if that happens she wouldnt be the same person that everyone loves so much..she talks alot about how her family isnt always there for her and i hope that me and others as her friends can help her with for being there and all... i read her live journal thing tonight and i just have to say that i luv u soo much and i hope that u dont let what ppl say get to u all the time and dont change for anybody u already have everyone as a friend ...i dont know i hope u take this entry as something that u wont get amd over and take it as me saying i luv ya and i hope we stay bff's hehe muah!!	f

"Hashem Aghajari has been handed a five-year jail term following his re-trial.  He was sentenced to death in 2002 for criticizing the ruling mullahs, calling for reform, religious renewal and for saying that Muslims are not ""monkeys"" who ""blindly follow"" the clerics.  The revised sentence came after the original one was overturned by the Iranian Supreme Court, at the urgings of Ayatollah Khamenei, the leader of Iran, in order to defuse mass student demonstrations."	m

"A good Italian meal, a couple of glasses of wine and the President for dinner. hmmm... why do I have indigestion?  I watched the President make the case for war with Iraq-- possible war, he called it-- while eating dinner tonight. I'm one of those few Americans who isn't virulently pro-war and isn't virulently anti-war. I'm kind of sitting on the fence on this one-- at least for the moment.  I'm cynical about the President's presentation of the case for war. This doesn't mean I think he's doing it for oil. That's way too naive. But this constant connection between what happened on 9/11 and Iraq makes me want to ask a lot of questions.  If this is a part of a new, more interventionist American doctrine toward the world, I'm willing to accept that. Mainly because I think it's the real reason behind what we're probably about to do in Iraq. But if that is the case, there are still plenty of questions. What are the limits of this doctrine? Does this mean a fundamentally unilateral approach to the world for the remainder of the Presdient's term? At it's heart, is there necessarily anything wrong with a more proactive stance, militarily speaking? If not, what about the international bodies and their continued relevance? Have those institutions lost their relevance? What about the expanding institutions like the EU and NATO?  I think these are important questions... so no, I'm not going to offer a quick and dirty opinion on war here. CNN and Fox News Channel specialize in quick and easy answers. I don't believe there are such things.  This was one of those days where I very nearly skipped working out. But I didn't and in the end, I was glad I went. I also had a good discussion with my friend Matt about a workout question that I'll pose to those of you who workout. If you're experiencing a great deal of muscle pain-- let's say in your thighs and butt from a particularly heavy workout yesterday... do you give yourself a rest today even though you were scheduled for a chest and biceps workout, for instance? Here's the question that underlies that: if we take a holistic view of our muscles does an exceptional strain on one muscle group result in a strain upon the others, too? Or should I go ahead with that chest and biceps workout even though my legs and butt are crying for mercy?  Matt posed that question to me... and it's a good one. Most of the time, I tend to compartmentalize my body. Muscle pain in one body part doesn't prevent me from working out another body part. But all of us know that under certain circumstances, working out with a cold can make the cold worse because the strain of muscle recovery causes your body to divert resources from fighting the cold. So b ack to the question. If my body is working hard to repair all the micro-tears in the muscles of my glutes and quadriceps... should I create more stress for it by working another body part today or should I give my body a day to rest? As usual, I can see the reasoning behind a couple different answers... pushing ahead or taking the day off. This is why I'd make a good diplomat but not a good politician.  Anyway... if you have any thoughts... write!!   urlLink Chrisonomicon  is enjoying the good life in Mexico and soon will be enjoying some time away in New York and Montreal. hmmm... I'm torn between going to Colorado to ravage  urlLink his boyfriend  or to NYC to ravage him. Both of those guys are hot young men... but of course, they are dating and thus are kind of off limits. But damn it... I'm single so let me have a little fantasy.  I'm at  urlLink Java Joe's  tonight. I have the evening off so I'm out with a couple good books and my Palm and keyboard to do some writing. The local salsa band Twistin' Trees is performing tonight-- actually a pretty good band. I had two glass of cabernet for dinner so I'm not too shy to stare back at the cute gay boys who are looking at me. Why do so many people treat this kind of behavior in such a nonchalant way? For me, it's still scary. Alhough I should be happy that it's not paralyzing me with fear... as it used to. My first instinct is still to look away if I see a cute guy and he returns my gaze. This has been proven to be a bad way to get dates. But I'm trying to be better about this. I wonder if there's a class I can take.  My latest really cheap, much desired item: a USB-powered light for my laptop. Ah, the simple things bring the most pleasure, dont they? :)  I'm actually looking for an excuse to buy a new Palm. This has been my quest since last year. And the Palm  urlLink Tungsten T  has been the most powerful argument so far for buying a new one. The ""T"" is lightning fast, has an incredibly bright screen... and will make it possible for me to buy a whole array of  urlLink new accessories ... something I can't easily do anymore for my old Palm Vx. There's a  urlLink Tungsten W  with wireless capability but I don't feel I need wireless capability in my Palm; besides, the ""W"" has less power than the ""T"" and runs an older version of the Palm OS. Why this is the case is a good question.  Maybe I should just be happy with my new CD burner. :)  My friend Gerry has developed  urlLink new software  that allows your computer to interact with a Replay TV box that has networking capability. I own a Replay 4000 so I might make that my next project... using my spare computer's 35 GB of free space to store TV programs for archival purposes.   mmmm... technology isn't as fun as sex... but sometimes it's almost as good as masturbation."	m
"Well, went to a house party with Chris. Seems like this is becoming our weekend routine. It still boggles my mind how some people cannot have a good time without liquor and drugs. Quoth the 18 year old who looked like a 14 year old with stretchy track pants and pretty much no shirt: ""Oh My GAWD! If I don't, like, get some marijuana soon I'll just, like, die!""  All the people, except Chris, Ben and I, were totally pasted. Eventually one guy got overly rambunctious trying to hug the other 18 year old who looked like a 14 year old, and tripped onto the kitchen table sending empties and half full bottles flying everywhere. A little while later the same guy dropped the fourty of vodka in the kitchen (smash). When the drug dealers in their pouffy jackets and sideways hats showed up, and the Aussies put on the Oh Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack and started screaming/singing Man Of Constant Sorrow, we decided it was time to leave.  It was a fun party in which to observe drunk/stoned students in their natural habitat. I realised after we left that Chris, Ben and I were 5-7 years older than everyone there. Maybe we should stick with the pub crawling scene..."	m
"The  urlLink U.N.  has voted to order Israel to remove its self-defense wall:     The vote in the 191-nation assembly was 150-6, with 10 abstentions.   All 25 European Union countries voted in support of the Palestinian-drafted measure after its Arab sponsors approved a series of amendments proposed by the EU bloc over days of intense negotiations.  The U.S. voted no.   Now would be a good time to review some choice U.N. quotes:    ""A theater of the absurd, a decomposing corpse and an insane asylum."" -- Daniel P.

BLAST IT! I just posted a really long and interesting post about stuff that i cant remember because i didnt expect to need to!   All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.	m
Today is my mom's birthday, but I won't disclose her age in respect for her. Not that she's old or anything. Anyway, I just want to let her know how grateful I am that she is my mom. She has supported me every day of my life. She's just cool like that. Happy birthday mom! I'll let you have a corner piece of the cake.  P.S.  People like the great Christina Ricci and that other guy, Abraham Lincoln, were born on February 12. Here's a list of other celebrities who were  urlLink born on this day  in history.	m
I know I have to complete the Quixtar info series I started but I am getting the revelation now ... what can I do?  So here is the most honest Quixtar plan. I challenge you to find a more honest Quixtar plan on earth! And it’s brief too. Trust me! I had seen 2 hours long plans. As much as I hate you, I would never do that to you.  So here it goes:   The Plan   Hello guys. My name doesn't matter, so is yours. I'm here to explain you the Quixtar plan. That’s right, Q-U-I-X-T-A-R, the same shitty company, illegitimate child of pimpish Amway.    I won't waste your time in a ridiculous dream building mumbo jumbo. I know you’re greedy all right. Here is a circle, that’s you.  Now all you have to do is pimp out your friends and family. When you run out of them you gotta find the other suckers. Y'all know this world is full of suckers who are as greedy as you are and will come running when they’ll hear money. Now you find some losers and bring them to the meeting. Some morons will join you, some won't. How many jackasses do you know?   A List:  Ok let’s start how to pimp out your friends and family first. This is easy stuff as you already know their weaknesses. What about your sister who just got divorced and looking for an opportunity to meet people? And your uncle Joe, who talks to himself since his wife died? How about your mom and dad who are way too lonely since you don't give a shit about them anymore? They'll do anything to have your company won't they? Just get their butts on the seat and any moron will be happy to kiss their asses and sell them this shit. You follow up with them and there is your pimping out part. Harass, beg or yell, get those retards sign up.   B List:  How about your colleagues who just got laid off? They’ve got some good severance shit and very eager to invest it wisely. Get them! Tell them to bring their portfolios etc. They'll come running! Invite them to the conference. You know they got the money to go there. After the conference those idiots will have no choice since they’ve spent most of their severance. Now they got to screw other people to get their money back. Sweet eh! And remember these seminars are where the gold is hidden! Seminars, books and tapes.   C List:  By the time you have screwed these people, you'll be a real tough sunuvabitch ready for the fresh meat. Go to the mall. Look out for the snobs wearing good dresses and fat wallets. Find an excuse to chat with them. Aim is to get their phone number. Hide if you have to, and corner them when you can so they have to talk to you. Don't let them go until they give you their phone numbers. Then call them. Don't EVER put the phone down until they agree to meet you. Now show them the plan!   Training:  How to further squeeze these ass holes? Simple! Same cycle again, pimp em out till they order! Beg, harass or yell and beat the PV out of them! Keep selling seminars, tapes and book. Those are shitty alright, but they'll keep the suckers longer.  Smart ones of these morons will start doing what you are doing, i.e. pimping other ppl out and squeezing their wallets by beating the PV out of them.  You got to have a real tough skin, be a stubborn sunnuvabitch and teach other people to be the same.  I won't waste your time in showing you the numbers, as they all are in that stupid looking file I gave ya. As much as I doubt your intelligence, I know you can understand those numbers. It's a pyramid, idiot! As simple as that. And if you haven't figured out yet, products are just a decoy. Tapes, book and seminars are the real money maker. You need to move enough products to qualify for that(tool) money. Get more ppl to go on top, and suck their blood as long as you can. Be a Dracula, go Diamond. Don't EVER tell any body about the return policy of the tools! It's just to keep the feds away.  Now, sign up, pah-lease! Else I won't let ya go......	m
"(Welcome to Paradise-Green Day) Mood: Hi Hey whats up? I'm so bored, I'm trying to pass the time but it's not working! So, I gotta check up on you guys...... 1) Did you go out and buy ""A Big Package For You"" yet?? 2) Did you check out Skaliosis?? ummm thats it but I really want you guys to look at both okay??

Just started redoing my website. I'll rebuild it slowly but surely. For a long time, I was able to store as much as I wanted on my server, even though I was supposed to be limited to about 5mb.  I could always just keep uploading documents.  I think at one point it reached a couple hundred mb.  Finally, my local ISP put something on their server that actually limited the amount you could upload, so whenever I tried to upload more, it was over my limit. Anyway, I finally decided to just delete it all and start from scratch.  Something very simple.  And probably something very boring, as always... Oh well.	m
Well, we just found out that the elderly lady's creepy grandson is...an ex-con! Yes, folks, he has been in jail and more than once. Once for stealing a car and for assualt. And whom did he assault? None other than HIS OWN MOTHER. He apparantly  broke her ribs  and also beat up his girlfriend. He has asked other neighbours for money and apparantly his grandmother, who lives with his mother, posted a sign on their door: No Cash. No Credit Cards. No Checks. DH got a 12 gauge shotgun. Can't seem to find rock salt. I feel so dirty having to buy a gun. Is that the weirdest? I don't feel more powerful or protected or secure. Just dirty.	f
"just reflecting over this past year and how my actions have caused me so much stress.  i've made myself miserable to no ends and havent really had a moment's peace.  it's made me lose over 50lbs which hey, im not complaining over but still its something my doctor's gonna be concerned about the next time i see her....  i'm actually amazed my body hasnt said ""screw you james, im taking a break"" and hasnt all but died on me.  i guess i learned to adapt to the stress or something i dunno.    but i finally decided not to allow myself feel so badly NE more cuz it wasnt just my fault.  i was lied to and acted under false pretenses.  it took someone i luv SCREAMING that fact @ me to finally get it.  so i've been worry-free now for a week or so but my stomach is all tense and in knots almost like im still upset.  but im not.... it's almost making me wonder if my body is suffering from withdrawl symptoms or something where i've functioned with this stress for so long now....  i know that sounds crazy lol  but still it really makes me reflect on the power of guilt....  oh well enuff of that.... gots to go out and enjoy the sunshine!  much luv me  ~xoxo~"	f
"I wonder sometimes, in awe, at the contra-dance that is the morning drop-off line of cars at the Middle School. Three grades drop off at three different entrances in the back of the school. Two lanes, one rotary, many cars,kids with poster boards, back packs, girls in short skirts in the rain, and moms and dads some just-barely-awake.  People seem to grok the pace and policy most mornings, and it is an intricate web of ""You go...no, YOU go's"". People are *actually* polite. Go Figure. Now, in Pittsburgh, this would not be an amazing thing. Boston, um, it should be written in the front pages of the Globe:  ""North Andover Residents found to be Polite in Early Morning Shuffle.""  This morning, as I was do-si-do'ing with an SUV I caught glimpse of a dad-hand holding a commuter mug of coffee, wedding ring glinting in the non-existent morning sun. Wipers swishing back and forth, I found myself in midst of a poignant moment.   Some days I want an SUV life. With a ""nice"" man, who wears a wedding ring and holds his coffee mug on the way to dropping the kids off at school. He probably made me some coffee and brought it to me before he left in the herd of backpacks and squealing, whining preteens.   My rattling 1989 Toyota Camery bumbles into the lot bearing the bumper stickers that read:  ""Well Behaved Women Rarely Make History"" and ""Carefully disguised as a Responsible Adult""  If it were not for the Hip-Hop station blaring on the radio I doubt my teenager would even allow me to enter the four-block radius. She hates my post-hippy-yet-well-educated-massage-therapist-to-be life. She wants a life more like Dad's, resplendent with grand pianos, fancy cars, trips to Tuscany.  I really don't want the SUV. Just the guy with the coffee cup, someone who is willing to invest in the love of his life as much and as deeply as this man is willing to invest in debt...someone to drive my kids to school, make me coffee.   Maybe the fact that I only have 500 bux in the bank after paying my $1,400 rent is getting to me.  Damn ambition.  Damn it to hell."	f
My agent wants to know if I'd like to write a book on Mac OS X. I know nothing about Mac, but I gave a brief thought to writing a book on the topic. It would give me an excuse to go out and buy one -- I've never used one before, and have always been curious about what those Mac-huggers have been ranting about. I'm almost (almost, I said) jealous about these people who are soooo fanatical about this company. I wish I had a company or a brand I could love. Why is a brand of computer so special? Us PC-huggers don't understand that. I have no loyalty to any brands -- sell me a no-name PC as long as its cheap. I did like my Dell laptop very much, and have a positive attitude toward Dell, although it won't be a deciding factor   In fact, I drink Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke interchangably. I go to Wendy's, Burger King, or McDonalds. No brand loyalty that I can think of. My last three cars have been all different manufacturers.	m
SATURDAY...   Today, Jene' and I had planned a quiet day.  Jene's been sick since Thursday (flu) and my allergies are making my throat feel as if it's on fire.  So, around 2:00 we get this call from Jene's brother-in-law -- he's in town and he wants to stop by.  (Actually, he wanted to go out to lunch, but since Jene's had the flu -- not a good idea).  I can only imagine what people thought of his license plates on first glance (State Official/SO 12).  In other words, if you see any  scandalous  headlines about Texas' highest ranking Hispanic elected official making  house  calls in Houston (to two little white women), they're not true.  He has his own little white woman in Austin.  Later in the day, our friend Nestor, who is moving to Florida at the end of this month, took us out to dinner.  Jene' had a very bland baked potato.  I had shepherd's pie (and my throat is still on fire).  Then we came back here and talked for a while, then Nestor went home to a barrage of e-mails from us about churches in the Melbourne, FL area, as well as where he could find Chinese food (6 places within a 46 mile radius).  Melbourne is a small town compared to Houston.  I'm sure he's in for some culture shock.   Now I'm feeling rather sleepy, except for this sore throat.	f
"3/31/04   Another month gone by....   Bah March is already over. How could I ever have thought time passed by slowly? I have no clue. But these last three months have been such a blur. And yes tomorrow will be the first day of April.....am I enthusiastic about it? NO. The only reason why I'd even like the month is because it marks the fact there's only two more months of school. Other than that....rain, worms, and work.....eew. At least Easter is during April ^_^. Hmm......but I'm happy March has gone by in a way. HUGE Bio seminar is finally over and  done, and my school average is at a healthy 85 ^_^. Shweet....so yeah March has been a good month.....and of course who could forget TC?! AMMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIINNNNNNGGGG. I just hope April will pass by as quickly as March....same for may.....and June.....then July and August......SLOW PLEAAAAAAASE.  Well this morning was Wednesday so another day of waking up really friggin' early. Yay....Intermediate band. Seems like such a joke after Senior Band just passed by on Tuesday. And I thought the music was a little bit difficult.....wow I can't wait until Gr. 11 next year. Music is actually amusing then hehe. Like usual....trombones sound good ^_^ and like usual Mr. Clark yells at woodwinds. Really the trombone/baritone section....really good section ^_^...  And after band music.....MORE MUSIC! Yes today was day two so I had music homeroom. Ran over music like usual....scales and such and then Mr. Clark took all the brass and we played some brass ensemble thing. So boring.....and we sound like crap lol. But Mr. Clark kept talking about how he gave Connor the lonely part so he'd suffer for all the trouble he causes in band lol. ""Mr. Clark what have I ever done?"" ""Want me to give the list in order? *ehem* Talk to Kurtis, Listen to Kurtis, Talk back to Kurtis...."" etc. etc. It's pretty funny though watching Mr. Clark seem to have this ""master"" plan. Oh yeah and Zavitz got these KILLER pair of shoes. THERE'S A STORY WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOES. Now THAT's unique. So yeah that was basically the whole music class.....being split up and playing music. Fun.  Science..........MORE NOTES! Some cheesy poor-graphic animated video about VECTORS. Wow.......1980's animation was horrible lol. But it was funny watching it in the making haha.  Lunch.....went to Galleria. What?  Bio......................................wow the people that presented today for bio class.......whipped right through it. Their notes were up for about 3 seconds a time......and yeah writing down the notes.......NEAR TO IMPOSSIBLE. It was a pretty cool presentation though....was about digestive system. One of the group memebers apparently has had life experience with some of the things that they presented. So yeah that made it pretty interesting actually. But yeah they kinda went through presentation a bit fast.....so no one really could take down any notes lol.  English.......OUR PLAY IS AMAZIN'! AMAAAAAAAAAAAASHING AAAH! UNSTOPPABLE! I actually can't wait till we present it on Friday.......it's actually a pretty funny play. So we spent most of the time rehearsing...then just sitting around and chatting......yeah it's a cool play though. Romeo and Juliet......FOB/Matrix/Mr. Bean style. REALLY messed up but funny hehehehe.  Bused home.  And now I'm blogging.......yeah my blog formats are all beginning to look the same. I still need to learn HTML and stuff.....or maybe how to use Dreamweaver in a productive fashion hehe. As of right now.......what's a Hyperlink? j/k I'm not that stupid. At least I can make my background sit in one spot now heehee. Hmm what do I have to do today........catch up on theory.......memorize English script......practice piano if I have time. Yeah my night's gonna be filled with crap. AWW NUTS I still have to do that canvassing thing. Well.....so far I have $5. Lol out of 10 people ONE PERSON donated. I'm gonna be puttin' in 10 though and mom's puttin in 20. So altogether...........$35 DOLLARS. WAAAH. Yeah but note to self: NEVER CANVASS DURING MARCH AGAIN. Wow it's FREEZING or it's SOAKING WET. I just hope I can finish at least 20 houses by tonight.  Well........so much for canvassing. In the end.......after canvassing whole Walmer Gardens.....TWO out of over 20 houses donated. *Shrug* maybe next time I do this I'll do it earlier in the year lol. So plus me and my mom donating the total $$$ made: $40!!!! Meh not much....but I hope it go into good use.   After coming back from that canvassing.......I went to drum for a bit....Hmm since one of my toms is broken decided to do a new drum layout. instead of 5-piece I do 4-piece set. Snare, tom, floor tom, and bass. So far....it's not bad. In fact I kinda like it ^_^  Well.....yeah I'm pretty much done for tonite.....got piano theory still and stuff. So until my next entry......KEEP FIT AND HAVE FUN *body break dun dun dun dun dun dun.* Hehe j/k j/k.....just have a nice day =P. Later."	m
Yay, my first entry! I'll admit that I feel like a big tool for actually creating a blog, but it's probably the closest thing I'll get to therapy on my current salary.  Plus, I figure it's practice for my upcoming book, currently untitled and unwritten. Today is Monday, July 12th (Chris's birthday, HAPPY BIRTHDAY KM!) and I am at work (boooo) enjoying some fresh brewed peach iced tea from Au Bon (yaaaay). Melanie and I are already super bored, it's 10:16 AM and I think we've already exchanged about 10 emails.  Doug (our president) and Chuck (our VP) are both on vacation this week and Laurie (my boss)called in sick today.  Key Office is a GHOST TOWN. To anyone who missed the party we threw this weekend, you suck and you missed a couple 2 pound lobsters, marinated steak tips and the best carrot cake this side of the Mississippi. Speaking of this weekend, I can't believe that Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery both did not qualify for the Olympics in the 100.   T minus 19 days until the Beach to Beacon and I am nowhere near ready to run 6.2 miles.  I ran for about 40 minutes yesterday but my knees started bothering me so I had to stop.  Plus, I picked up a sweet  wine  rack on the side of the road, so even if I wanted to keep running I couldn't.  Yes...I am that girl. Anyway, like I said it's Monday (boooo) but at least it's quiet at work so I can get a lot done...like, create a blog.	f
"Toy Firm Markets Talking Jesus Action Doll   A US toy firm has created a talking action doll of Jesus Christ which recites the Ten Commandments.  Herobuilders says it has come full circle and created ""the only real hero:  Talking Our Lord Jesus Christ Action Figure"".  It's Jesus action figure stands 12'' high, wears biblical robes and costs about $10.   Ok, so i'm not exactly sure what to say about this one.  Kinda speechless.  Where the heck would you get the idea to make a Talking Jesus Action Figure that recites the 10 Commandments?  Sometimes i just don't understand people."	m

"Have you ever had a perfect day with laughter and happiness, evaporate like the rain on a hot summer pavement road. Have you ever had so much love built up inside you that you would sacrifice your very happiness, your very existence, your very soul, for the one that you knew that you truly deeply love inside?  Listen up, focus in, sit back and absorb my thoughts and emotions, because I'm going to tell you about my true love, my life, my reason for being here now.....Steven Michael.  I meet a young man walking past me. He walked with pride and he floated with happiness. His smile would set you on fire inside, his blond hair would turn heads. His personality was one that was envied by others. He would help you out and sacrifice his time. He would be there for you in time of need. He drove a white impecable, glistening, flawless, Nissan, he was a Knight in shining armor.  I remember these days like yesterday. I remember such happiness, honesty, truthfulness.   His presence was angelic and full of love. His laughter was always contagious, his thoughts and words when he spoke were wise and intelligent. He was as perfect and God fearing as every man should be.  I had to be a part of his life. I had to be the one for him. As we fast forward through the years, we developed a friendship envied by others. We then developed a love like no other. We would explore life together in so many avenues. If there was ever a time to be apart we would find our way back to each other.  Here is a man that has filled my heart with pure joy, happiness, and laughter. Here is a man that has grown into a mystery and became dark. In ways to protect me he shields his thoughts and actions, to keep me happy. However, for me to look into his green eyes I can find unhappiness, hurt, pain, despair and uncertainty. How long could I let this heartache of his go on? I see in his eyes that he longs for another. I see in his eyes the demons he has to battle with nightly, as I cannot be there to hold him. I see that he has to play out this fantasy in his head, his role is to save the lady in waiting, will he succeed? How can he when he has the temptation, the reality of flesh in his hand daily....Me.  So I must be decide to make the ultimate sacrifice...LOVE. I love Steven more than you could possibly think to love the person that you say that you love and adore. I love Steven more than my own happiness. I must decide to free this man, who's in pain and conflict with himself, I must turn him back into the world to fight these battles within him. For unless Steve is happy with himself, he would truly never be happy with me.  I pray that he will understand the terms that I must go. For it will never be out of hate, or for another, or jealously, it's out of LOVE, that I give him up. It's the LOVE that you give when nothing else matters. I have been a disease, I have inadvertently stunted his growth. I have not done well to allow him to experience life as I have.  I have grown to appreciate the meaning of true love. I have grown to understand that loving someone isn't about your happiness, it's about making them happy. This is what I have done for Steve, I know I have made him happy. I have had the heart ache and the pains and the loneliness to truly know what it means to be under each other's skin. To be inside your heart and soul. I have existed both ways.  As Steve held my hand tight, I knew that his heart was dying inside, and that his mind was spinning in circles. I could see him going in and out, as if he had been on life support, and as I gently pulled away I was unplugging him. I knew he didn't want to let me go, and I was unclear when he said that he needed to work through this. I know that he does, but did he mean to say he wanted me here with him to help him work through this? Could I do that for him.  Just as he stated that ever since we have been together there has been a ""pause"" in his life. Well, lets just say the ""truth hurts"" and the ""truth will set you free"". So as words flowed from him so did my decision. You see my life has been focused around him I have lived here. Stayed here. Lived my lifestyle to his, because it made me happy to do so. I know that he loves me, and I hear from him that he hates to see me unhappy. Well I love him so much I hate to see him unhappy too.  I know that no one will ever agree with this. WE have so many friends that only know us as a couple. We have family that only know us as always together. I know Steve and he will fight this battle. He will get himself through this. But as I move on. I know him, he will not find me. He will not come to me. I will have started over, perhaps waiting for him, perhaps not. This is what I call self sacrificing and God will let life continue on.  I heard of a young girl passing on tonight. She was only 19 years old. How is it that she is just beginning her life and it was taken? When my heart suffers now, when it bleeds and tears over flow. Why does life seem so cruel? Life can take your happiness and turn it into sorrow at a blink of an eye.  I will want to pass this off as never happening. I will want to be in denial and forget this was ever discussed. I will only remember this happened, when I reach for the phone to ask him if he's ready to go do something, for there won't be that luxury, and tears will flow. I will remember when I go to IM him to say ""hi"" and tears will flow. I will remember when I drive by his house and park, but not get out, thinking I was going into tickle him and to hug and kiss him. I will remember when I hit speed dial on my phone to tell him ""I love you"", and my eyes glaze over with water as I drown in my thoughts. I will remember most when I hear our song, when I hear your guitar playing in my head, when I cry out at night on a lonely road, with no one to come home to. I will remember when I had this conversation with Steve, when I go to hold his hand and it's gone.  I don't want to sleep. I don't want to move. I want to go over and crawl up next to him and have him hold me through the night and let the sunrise together, so that I can say this was a bad dream. I am so paralyzed and scared of what might not be once I go on another day with out him. I feel the emotions of time and time again of our break ups. I feel the pain. It's different at this moment, it's a self sacrificing pain. It's one that is filled with love.  Why am I such a fool? To be so very very much in love.  As I mark this as a journey through a broken heart, you'll know that I have loved a man named Steven Michael like I have loved no other before.  As we both promised tonight that we would ""go peacefully"".  ""God I pray to you tonight please give us the strength to carry on...Living...Please watch over him...Please see him through these battles....Please carry him back safely unblemished and cleansed...So that he can be well again and...Sleep again....Carry him back to my open arms...Please dear Lord I pray this in your name....""  ~""Amen"""	f
Ok... not exactly productive like I hoped. All I did was cook dinner for myself, and did some throwing out of old papers. Then watch a bunch of TV with Derek and Kaho. I feel like such a bum.  **	m
"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/03/opinion/03KRUG.html urlLink     Standard Operating Procedure By PAUL KRUGMAN   The mystery of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction has become a lot less mysterious. Recent reports in major British newspapers and three major American news magazines, based on leaks from angry intelligence officials, back up the sources who told my colleague Nicholas Kristof that the Bush administration ""grossly manipulated intelligence"" about W.M.D.'s.   And anyone who talks about an ""intelligence failure"" is missing the point. The problem lay not with intelligence professionals, but with the Bush and Blair administrations. They wanted a war, so they demanded reports supporting their case, while dismissing contrary evidence.   In Britain, the news media have not been shy about drawing the obvious implications, and the outrage has not been limited to war opponents. The Times of London was ardently pro-war; nonetheless, it ran an analysis under the headline ""Lie Another Day."" The paper drew parallels between the selling of the war and other misleading claims: ""The government is seen as having `spun' the threat from Saddam's weapons just as it spins everything else.""  Yet few have made the same argument in this country, even though ""spin"" is far too mild a word for what the Bush administration does, all the time. Suggestions that the public was manipulated into supporting an Iraq war gain credibility from the fact that misrepresentation and deception are standard operating procedure for this administration, which  to an extent never before seen in U.S. history  systematically and brazenly distorts the facts.  Am I exaggerating? Even as George Bush stunned reporters by declaring that we have ""found the weapons of mass destruction,"" the Republican National Committee declared that the latest tax cut benefits ""everyone who pays taxes."" That is simply a lie. You've heard about those eight million children denied any tax break by a last-minute switcheroo. In total, 50 million American households  including a majority of those with members over 65  get nothing; another 20 million receive less than $100 each. And a great majority of those left behind do pay taxes.  And the bald-faced misrepresentation of an elitist tax cut offering little or nothing to most Americans is only the latest in a long string of blatant misstatements. Misleading the public has been a consistent strategy for the Bush team on issues ranging from tax policy and Social Security reform to energy and the environment. So why should we give the administration the benefit of the doubt on foreign policy?   It's long past time for this administration to be held accountable. Over the last two years we've become accustomed to the pattern. Each time the administration comes up with another whopper, partisan supporters  a group that includes a large segment of the news media  obediently insist that black is white and up is down. Meanwhile the ""liberal"" media report only that some people say that black is black and up is up. And some Democratic politicians offer the administration invaluable cover by making excuses and playing down the extent of the lies.  If this same lack of accountability extends to matters of war and peace, we're in very deep trouble. The British seem to understand this: Max Hastings, the veteran war correspondent  who supported Britain's participation in the war  writes that ""the prime minister committed British troops and sacrificed British lives on the basis of a deceit, and it stinks.""  It's no answer to say that Saddam was a murderous tyrant. I could point out that many of the neoconservatives who fomented this war were nonchalant, or worse, about mass murders by Central American death squads in the 1980's. But the important point is that this isn't about Saddam: it's about us. The public was told that Saddam posed an imminent threat. If that claim was fraudulent, the selling of the war is arguably the worst scandal in American political history  worse than Watergate, worse than Iran-contra. Indeed, the idea that we were deceived into war makes many commentators so uncomfortable that they refuse to admit the possibility.  But here's the thought that should make those commentators really uncomfortable. Suppose that this administration did con us into war. And suppose that it is not held accountable for its deceptions, so Mr. Bush can fight what Mr. Hastings calls a ""khaki election"" next year. In that case, our political system has become utterly, and perhaps irrevocably, corrupted."	m

七里香  七里香  詞：方文山 曲：周杰倫   窗外的麻雀 在電線桿上多嘴  妳說這一句 很有夏天的感覺  手中的鉛筆 在紙上來來回回  我用幾行字形容妳是我的誰   秋刀魚 的滋味 貓跟妳都想了解  初戀的香味就這樣被我們尋回  那溫暖 的陽光 像剛摘的鮮豔草莓  你說妳捨不得吃掉這一種感覺   雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  院子落葉 跟我的思念厚厚一疊  幾句是非 也無法將我的熱情冷卻  妳出現在我詩的每一頁   雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  窗台蝴蝶 像詩裡紛飛的美麗章節  我接著寫 把永遠愛妳寫進詩的結尾  妳是我唯一想要的了解   那飽滿 的稻穗 幸福了這個季節  而妳的臉頰像田裡熟透的蕃茄  妳突然 對我說 七里香的名字很美  我此刻卻只想親吻妳倔強的嘴  haas..jay chou's new song..qi li xiang, nt bad lar..lolx	m
"Eh, tonight wasn't all what it cracked up to be...I think. I was SUPPOSED to go play pool and go bowling at the U of M student center, but no one would go. And the people who said they might, didn't. blerg. I'm itching to try and duplicate that double-shot that I literally dropped jaws with last week at the underground. lol. Maybe tommorow night or something. And don't ask me to describe that shot-I already tried it, and its quite hard to picture it. Just ask Amelia.  I should probably get my own cue sometime. Then I can become a pool-shark/hustler for the rest of my life. Great prospect, huh? Not really...  To quote Pat, ""My head feels so...naked!"" Yes, I did it. I had a hair cut. Now its short (omg!). I look like a whole different person, its kinda creepy. Hopefully my personality doesn't change-I like that the way it is very much. Grr...now I get cold quicker. Oh well, I'll grow it out again, and it should be long again by the time MITY rolls around. I lost so much hair...meh-I got pictures of me with the long hair right before I cut it lol.  Some people will probably look at me and say, ""oh my god what did you do?"", well, here's a Ben Folds Five lyric:  ""What I've kept with me And what I've thrown away And where the hell I've ended up On this glary random day Were the things I've really cared about Just left along the way For being too pent up and proud  Woke up way too late Feeling hungover and old And the sun was shining bright And I walked barefoot down the road Started thinking about my old man Want to get into a car and go anywhere  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  Don't you know I'm numb, man? I can't feel a thing at all Now it's all smiles and business these days I'm indifferent to the loss I have faith that there's a soul somewhere That's leading me around I wonder if she knows Which way is up and which is down  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  I poured my heart out I poured my heart out It evaporated ... see?  Blind man at a canyon's edge Of a panoramic scene Or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random Dangling a string Or slumped over in a vacant room Head on a stranger's knee I'm sure back home they think I've lost my mind  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?""  -""Evaporated""  Yeah, my hair evaporated...lol."	m
Why can't politicians drink caffeinated soda and be hyper?   I think best when I am hyper.  I look awake when I am hyper.  Politicians always look tired.  Why not drink a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi and be hyper?  You notice I am stereotyping a whole lot.  Do I care?  I do not care.  Why?  Because I'm thirsty for more Pepsi.	m
“It’s okay if you can stand to let her dance. It’s okay it’s your right, come on and take a chance.”  – Cat Power, “Free.”  For whatever reason, I during my brief time as a music writer I have probably had more conversations with musicians and other writers about Chan Marshall, aka Cat Power, than any other contemporary artist.  Certainly her name comes up more often than Sleater-Kinney (my very favorite rock band – and who my friends believe are an obsession), the White Stripes (arguably the hottest rock band today – whom I also love dearly), Justin Timberlake (whose  Justified  album was one of the most pleasant surprises I’ve encountered as a CD reviewer), or Wilco or Death Cab for Cutie (two hipster faves that I have trouble sinking my teeth into, despite numerous attempts).  The topic is never how great her records are (although the few that I own I found having great moments of inspired songwriting and beautiful harmonies, but often inconsistent).  No, everyone seems to want to talk about her live shows, as her stage fright is the stuff of legends: she is known to play entire stretches of her set with her back to the audience,  stop in the middle of songs and start over and other bizarre behavior you would not expect from an established, nationally known musician.  I saw her twice (she opened a pair of dates for Sleater-Kinney in Seattle last December) before last weekend and I thought both times she performed pretty well, although unmemorable either way – her sets were not train wrecks, or were they inspiring or brilliant.  “I thought she was pretty good” is not great party conversation and I’ve found the idea of being drawn to her disastrous performances as kind of like laughing at the poor kid at school, so I’ve never really been comfortable being in conversations about her.  Last weekend, when she played at the Sasquatch! festival at the Gorge in Eastern Washington, the first 40 minutes of her set were hard to watch.  She sat at her piano (which she rarely, if at all) almost motionless behind dark sunglasses in a heavy, hooded sweatshirt.  Between songs she’d ask the crowd “whasssssuuuupppppp????” in a bizarre voice and let out some weird noises and said little else.  It was painful to watch, but I couldn’t possibly leave my great spot in the crowd as the New Pornographers and SK were the two following bands – both favorites of mine.  With five minutes left in her allotted 45 minutes, Marshall’s backing band left the stage and a DJ started to play a record that was very familiar to me, but I’m not sure to how many others in the large crowd.  It was the voice of a very young girl saying something like, “this next song is our first song, and it’s also our rap song. It’s called ‘Rad.’” The band being played was the amazing Seattle sister act Smoosh (for more info, see their web site  urlLink www.smoosh.com  or read my article in the current issue of ROCKRGRL).  After one false start, Marshall proceeded to dance and lip synch to “Rad,” a song written by two girls that are probably a third of her age.  It was one of my absolute favorite moments in watching live music (and I’ve been to probably hundreds of rock shows in the past few years).  Cat Power had seemed to toss out all of the hang-ups that dogged her throughout the previous forty minutes (and much of her career) and bedroom-danced before a crowd of thousands with an obvious joy rarely seen among indie-rock performers (the only thing that would have made it more perfect would be for her to replace her turned-off microphone with a hairbrush).  I’m sure I saw Smoosh for the first time the same time Cat Power did (Smoosh and Marshall were the first and second acts opening for SK late last year) and was drawn to the great, fun, catchy pop music that they were making.  It reminded me of the when I fell in love with pop music: when I heard the Beach Boys for the first time.  I’ve almost forgotten the first forty minutes of her set, but I’ll always remember her dancing to “Rad.”  It’s a moment I’d be more than happy to talk about with anyone who will listen.  Of course saying “Cat Power gave the most fun live performance I’ve ever witnessed” is something no one would ever believe if they didn’t see it for themselves	m

Interesting point accoding to  urlLink Vertegaal  the direction you look is important in (virtual) meetings. He used eye tracking to get the avatar look at what the user was looking at. In my case there is no eye-tracking possibility but it made me think about how the other knows what you are looking at. Original idea was a 3D arrow other options are: -display 3d view bounding box of the other -display target point of the other -share view, multiple views in one window -see through the eyes of the other problems: what about low/high res screens? (800x600 vs 1600x1200) what about low/high speed positions what about viewing angles	m
"Heh, Switzerland is cool, my neighbor is from Switzerland.  At least her ancestors were.  I made a post yesterday, but it didn't come through. AGH, there was a great song in there,  Outshined  by Soundgarden. That was how I was feeling yesterday, I'll post it again, it needs to go on PB2. And...umm....  I've got a stupidish song stuck in my head that I'll probably post here (if I can choke down the shame) and put on the second CD, it's an....uh......Avril Lavigne song.....put those rocks down...

Ok, movie update.   Euro Trip: I saw this with Mike and Matt, and I'm only putting this in here 'cause those dumb motherfuckers asked me too. What a shitty movie. The really sad thing was Boat Trip, the movie about a gay cruise, had less MALE nudity, and more FEMALE nudity... Euro Trip= waste of time.   Mike's house was fun anyway...I was kind of cranky in the morning though.   Pulp Fiction: Pretty good movie. I can tell that a lot of movies got their ideas from this. Too bad I've already seen all of them so it doesn't seem as cool and original as it could. Anyway, it's still really good.   Sleepy Hallow: What an incredible collection of great cast and crew. Just a FEW of the amazing actors: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, and many more. And then director Tim Burton, executive producer Francis Ford Coppla, and the special effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic or whatever the company is called. Incredible stuff, good movie.	m

"When a man sets some goals and sets off to pursue them, he is alone. He doesn't like it so he calls some other men to accompany him. For some distinct reasons, none can accompany him, so he is left alone. Desolate and lonely, yet with a fire to Go and a desire to Succeed, he starts off. He hasn't reached far when he hears somebody yelling, ""Hey, I am coming with you until our paths don't divert and separate us"".  Well, what would the man say? He happily agrees, for, they are just a few steps that matter.  (We all are here to walk those few steps for us and then we might cease to be, but Life never ceases. It goes on and will go on until, the Creator, decides otherwise. We must try to walk those two steps of our few steps with someone who wants us or whom we want. We can always take our own path on the crossroad where we take our separate paths to our individual goals.)  While the two were on the way, they were happy but felt there could be more. So, they called up more people to join in. They heard someone saying, ""I am already on my way and will join you guys at milestone 'A'. Now there is hope for these guys. Hope to meet this person at milestone 'A' and they have got a short-term goal to reach milestone 'A'.  This is what Life is made of...Short and Long-term goals, Starting-off alone with hope of meeting more people, Going on even when u r alone, with hope...We must never be afraid of starting it, all alone, as looking at your desire to reach your goals, more people would want to join u. I believe, positive attitude attracts. Let's have it.  What do u say? Helloooo!!!! Anybody there? Am I all alone? So what, I hope they would soon join me..."	m

New Mother India       Region   Waltham     Address   336 Moody St.     Phone   781-893-3311     Web    http://www.newmotherindia.com/      Price   $6.95     Buffet Hours   11:30am - 3:00pm tues-fri only, despite what it says on their website.     Payment options   cash, credit card     Ambience  Presentation   one of the first things i noticed when i arrived here was the lack of an indian smell about the place. most places have that warm, inviting scent of dark spices and tandoori meats that gets your mouth watering before you even walk in the door. this place has the buffet in a separate room and the kitchen so far back that no scent of indian food touches your nostrils until you're ready to eat. also, the mood is further set by an extremely bright dining area with no noticeable windows, a lack of music and a lack of a single indian customer.     this restaurant is one of the big stumpers of my current hometown. i have been here to eat dinner and been incredibly impressed. their menu is incredibly varied, and their food is always very, very well done. the rating they have as possibly one of the best indian restaurants in the boston area is well deserved -- as long as you only have dinner.  the buffet is a different story. i don't understand the point of having a buffet at your restaurant unless it represents your dinners and gets people to come back. i have given this place a couple of previous chances, in the hopes that i had simply hit it on a couple of bad days, but i took an extra long lunch break from work this friday so i could review the place on a day when the buffet is actually running, and so i had to take what i got. by now you can probably tell that this is going to be another bad review. i don't like to do them, but the people must know(tm).  there were no samosas, and the only other item that passed for a deep-fried appetizer was the  broccoli pakora . i skipped this since i don't do broccoli, and dug in elsewhere. the  rice  was nice to look at but kind of bland. the  paratha  was well done but a little greasy. i don't understand why places serve non-absorbent bread with buffets, but to new mother's credit, they do like to mix it up a bit with the breads on their buffet -- not always the same plain naan. last time it was broccoli naan, which i ate only because it was better than wasting the sauces.  this place's buffet has a full salad bar with fruit and veggies which could be a little fresher. the addition of chinese crispy noodles is a little disturbing in this environment; though i do enjoy them i just couldn't bring myself to put them on the same plate with indian food. to their credit, they do serve two different soups each day, one coconut soup and one  dal , which was a little watery for my taste but had a nice tang to it.  a new saag dish for me was  beef saag  (i know it's standard, i've just never seen it on a buffet before). it was actually quite well textured and spiced, and the beef was tender. the same goes for their  tandoori chicken , which was tender and tangy and just about right. the  chicken tikka masala  was probably one of the most disturbing flavorings i've ever had. the smoky flavor tasted almost as if it had been added afterward, and the taste reminded me very much of these really good beef hotdogs i used to have as a kid. while the taste memory was pleasant, the reality returned to me with the fact that this was chicken tikka masala and it's  not  supposed to taste like wild winds beef hots. there was an uneventful  dal makhni , and a  punjabi curry  which was pakoras in a tangy yellow mustard-based yogurt sauce. there was no dessert, not even kheer. frankly, i could have had better food from one of the microwave packets i get at waltham india grocery.      Absolute Rating   this place would have gotten a better rating if i didn't know they were capable of so much better food. stay away for lunch, save your judgement of this place and eat dinner here instead.  5/10      Value Rating   5 over $6.95 =  0.72      Fallingblox ate here last   Friday, July 23, 2004	m
"The Present Test  XX called me yesterday from his layover in Detroit and we had a brief chat. He blurted out, ""You don't have a mini-Eiffel Tower yet, do you?"" and I said no. If that fucker gives me a mini-Eiffel Tower, then I'm going to turn off all feeling for him. A mini-Eiffel Tower isn't a present that a lover gives--it's reserved for friends and family. My confidantes tell me that I can do better than XX/Fucko, but what if I just want to make out with someone  now ? This is the eternal dilemma. But to put my life in perspective, what would I rather have, immediate gratification or something better in the long run? Something better in the long run, I guess. Someone special who doesn't come home from Europe and present me with a mini-Eiffel Tower. If I get this mini-monument, I'll be disappointed, because there's nothing special about it--it's a common cheap trinket found all over Paris--and thus, it'll mean that there's nothing special between me and XX.

Indeed I will be getting out of town.  There's a girl who is like a drug. I like how I feel when I talk to her. Her charm and wit affects me by making a sensation of relaxation fill my muscles as I slink back and smile. She tempts me with feelings. That is she makes me feel. She makes me feel sorrow, joy, contentment, good, and bad all at once. I like simply feeling something, anything... but at the same time I desire more. I want her? It's 'cause this desire, like an addiction leads to path that doesn't end... and you walk and walk until you wear yourself out. Walking and walking, or perhaps talking and talking is more like it. Things are said that are more than just words. In them there is meanings that I don't know if are real or not. If they are embedded by her mind or mine? Tonight I shall resist, but will I keep my promise to myself to continue resisting? This girl is the first girl I can say I really liked, without doubt. She's too special and that's why she's the only person I had a serious thing for and stayed friends with. That's why I need to resist.  *	m
How I survived 9 months (twice) with no sushi is a complete and utter miracle. It feels so heavenly to be able to eat it again. We had it for dinner tonight and it was delish, especially because we washed it down with warm Sake. Yum. We got spicy tuna, California and Philadelphia rolls, flying fish eggs, salmon and yellowtail along with miso soup.  When I was preggers I would fill a small bowl with soy sauce and add a huge wad of wasabe and then drink it. It was a weak substitute, but satisfied the craving nonetheless. (Hey, we do what we have to)!  Now it's time to make good on my promise from last night. Treadmill, here I come.	f

...BONNIE FORMS FROM THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWO IN THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO... AT 4 PM CDT...2100Z...THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM BONNIE WASLOCATED NEAR LATITUDE 23.2 NORTH...LONGITUDE  88.7 WEST OR ABOUT 410 MILES SOUTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. BONNIE IS MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST NEAR 12 MPH...AND THIS GENERAL MOTION IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE TONIGHT.  A GRADUAL DECREASE INFORWARD SPEED AND A TURN TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED ON TUESDAY. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE NEAR  45 MPH... 75 KM/HR...WITH HIGHERGUSTS.  SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT24 HOURS. Interests on the Gulf Coast should monitor this system closely. Looks like this one will head to Florida/Alabama. Looks like it will not strengthen into a hurricane at this point.  Also - TD#4 is in the Carribean - it is forcased that Saturday it will be Hurricane Charlie and entering into the Gulf of Mexico. This could be a big one.  Keep posted for updates.	f
Well, Brice's new Dell computer was delivered on Friday, so he had Darian and I come over to help him set it up. We were there for like half and hour before we screwed it up. It appears that his computer gets upset when you try to upgrade his video card drivers to the new NVIDIA Detonators. Somehow, the video drivers that Dell provided also make the DVD drive work, so when we removed them, the video was screwed up and we couldn't get the old drivers back off of the CD. On top of all that, Windows explorer wouldn't start up, so we were also left with a blank screen and no way to fix it. So we reinstalled Windows, and everything pretty much returned to the way it was when the computer first arrived. Of course we had to install Quake 3 on it before we left, but that was a given. Another problem we found was that we could only connect to the Internet using the dumb Dellnet thing. Whenever we clicked on Internet Explorer, a window would pop up and tell us to click on the Dellnet icon. This is stupid because Brice connects to the Internet using DSL, not dial-up. Darian figured this one out when he ran the Internet Connection Wizard in the Internet Explorer folder and changing his connection to LAN. The biggest problem that I found with his computer was that it starts up entirely too fast. Of course, that's a problem I hope to have in the near future. --: p	m
Here I had plans to do all kinds of promotional work with Mom's Market, even make some changes and update pages, but I keep comming up with one idea after another. Anita and I did some brainstorming today on another event, which I'll be excited to get started within in the next few days. I just hope I have enough timenext week to do some work on my hobby site. Sadly I may not, because there is another website idea I would like to get started. My hobby site may once again take the back seat to big business. *sigh* One of these days I swear I'll finish it, and make it a money maker too. I found a little extra time last week and ran with a few ideas, so that pleased me temporarily until I can do some real work to them.   I suppose this week hasn't been too terrible so far - I managed to work on the advertising information page, update the  urlLink Back To School  section on Mom's Market, as well as write an article and get it submitted to various places. I did get a section of the shops updated as well, so that also pleased me.   Today I think I may take off just a bit early, and take the kids outside to play. I got a little side tracked playing with my CD collection. Eh, oops. Well what would you do if you found a CD that had been missing for 3 years and was one of your favorites? What can I say, I love music.  Tomorrow I think I'll start working on the new event we have planned for September, and also another idea that's just starting. I think I would feel good about working on those ideas, not to mention that it really is direct promotion and improvement of Mom's Market.   Well the children are getting restless, asking every 2 seconds if it's time to go out yet - I had better get going!  ~Kara	f

"Jerel called me just awhile ago to tell me, ""We're going to the parade next year."" I said, ""What parade?"" He says, ""The Laker Parade.""  So Karl Malone decided to  urlLink jump on board , too.

"I will be 18 years of age. I will be able to die for my country in battle, buy a piece of property, even decide who will lead our country for the next four years. That last privilege is one that will impact many, many lives, more so then usual, and if all us ""young people"" do not participate in this very important act, things could go horribly wrong. Tonight I was schooled on this, and I was forced to grow up a little bit.  In order to vote properly, you have to have a set of ideals, know whether any of the candidates share in these ideals, and be willing to compromise on their ideals you do not share. I was never one to follow politics, its so messy. Candidates are too concerned with getting votes than just showing who they are and what they will do. Its about getting elected, not leading the country. I knew that this was something I'd eventually have to get into because I hate the thought of being a stupid ""young person"" who doesn't care less about where the country is headed. I just didn't expect it to come so soon.  So I joined my new roomie and her friends at Fridays tonight for some late night munchies. We began discussing Kerry and Bush (there were 2 VERY SUPPORTIVE Kerry-ins) and everyone else didn't have much to say. I decided to play Devils Advocate just to see where it would go. From the Presidential Election we moved to Gay marriages and progressed to Religion. We were a bunch of late teens discussing the major debates of society. It felt good.  But as good as it felt at the time, I look back on it now and realize that I like to discuss topics, not get in heated debates about them. We almost got to that point tonight. And with my firm beliefs about my religion and the good man upstairs, sometimes people get defensive when discussing these fragile concepts. Case and point: Do not get into a discussion about the differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Episcopal (Anglican) Church with a Catholic and an Anglican... It may get ugly. But the point I'm trying to make is that if everyone could put their thoughts aside for a moment and realize that sometimes there's another way of looking at things, maybe things would be a little bit easier. Maybe this scramble for presidency wouldn't be a competition for votes, but a a competition for values. Things get interesting between two people when they can listen to each others differences without taking it as a personal offense.  Maybe I'm just too naive to realize the harsh realities of life. Maybe I just need to take off these glasses... Maybe I have a point.       Sleep tight.  I now travel to my dreams, where forever I will be young"	f
"urlLink   I turned off comments for now because it causes asstr's main page to get filled by copies of all my posts as individual pages...  If you got something to say, use the little box at right to send me a memo and if you want it posted, let me know. Yes, this does mean that unlike comments I have an easier luxury of censoring - but it's better than nothing.  So what's this about it being done?  Well, while I don't have too many stories out there, I still get that feedback from the odd reader asking me what happens next, or if I can write this character or that one into a story of their own.  The answer is simple - when a story is done, it is done. A story captures a moment in time, and the rest of that person's life is likely to just be ""get up, feed the kids, buy coffee on the way in to work, put in my hours, take off for home, deal with the husband, go to bed, maybe get laid, repeat.""  Or whatever. Suffice it to say, if there isn't drama, there isn't a story. I'm here to write the part that counts. I'm not going to continue out my characters until the inspiration is lost and it starts to look like an old, stale soap opera. This may be America where I'm writing from, but that doesn't mean I have to write like an American... :)  When the story is done, it's done.   So why did I start this blog, when I'm not the most famous writer you ever heard of, and I only have a small body of work? Well, I'm hoping this thing and my work can grow together. You can see from entries below just how much dedication I have to whatever it is I'm writing at a given moment, with luck, we'll all get to see me go through that with future stories as well.  With luck, I'll get a decent body of readers over time for this place as well, maybe even as many as I have for my stories (cause hey, that would only mean I end up with even more readers for the stories, right?).  Anyway, enjoy your evening."	f
I guess today wasn't to bad. Normal boring day. The plus was that my boyfriend came over. It was fun, we watched a movie. I hardly get to see him, so any time together is good. Well all was well until the end. My mom called me up for something, and we got in a small argument. That just pushed me over the edge i guess. Something inside me just snapped. A small gloom set over me. Then we were watching tv (my bf and I) and my dad gets home, of course my parents start to fight. Anyways. I dunno what happend from there. I just totaly fell apart. I wanted to cry so badly, but i dont know why. My insecurity must be comming back. After i tried so hard to surpress it...it comes back to haunt me. Why? Every time I am able to confront and conqure my sorrow...it comes back ten fold. Now i just feel depressed again. It hurts. I want releif, but my relief is gone for now. So of course eventually i gave in to my boyfriend, and just cried. I sat there and cried until he had to go. It wasn't long, but i still had no reason to cry. So it was pointless. But he said it wasn't, perhaps he's right. I dont know...I dont know anything anymore...why wont this darkness just leave me the hell alone!!!	f
Just saw this advert for lingerie saying 'feel like a woman'! Maybe it's for men...	f
Not sure what open weekends I have in May just yet- I think I have to go out of town the first two weekends for work (god please find me another job!).  Is it possible to have a love affair with tennis shoes? I just got a brand new pair of New Balance and I won't take them off.   Karissa informed me that I've been relatively MIA on the blogger- sorry for that. We just had the trip to Memphis this weekend. Other than fighting at Graceland- we had a great time. The drive was good- the visit was good- BB King's restaurant was GREAT. Saw an excellent blues band and had a wonderful time. Then on Sunday we had lunch at Isaac Hayes restaurant and saw a cool jazz band. We also played mini-golf. He beat me by ONE point- I was pissed. However, I still made him buy me a $10 costume jewelry ring. It's totally gawdy, and I love it. It's all blue and turquoise clear stones- and it's adjustable.   How hard could it be to make a monkey pinata?	f
Hi everyone, Thanks alot for all your replys,  Nicki, thanks and it is the 18th of May, dont buy me anything Max, becuase you are the only person i know who will be able to sort out things i dont know about! Paul, Urm yea Tom, a public thanks to you and Snooboo.com for brightening up my day yesterday with the polar bears and badgers, graphics. Thankyou. My day today has been better, things are starting to look up, went out with the woman, to London, fun. Had dinner with her and her parents, urm funny. And by the way i am bringing her to Andys party, if anyone wants to meet her, and you are invited (if you arnt invited, go and be nice to Andy) We will be there.

Dave	m

ok i got beef. This may come across as a little weird here but about to take the big 40cm step right onto my own personal soapbox in support of the Dixie Chicks. Well in support of them in as far as recent events connected to them have illistrated a wider problem with which I got major beef. Lead dixie chich singer with bad perm makes one crack at a London gig, saying she's not being thrilled about being from the same state as the man about to launch an ILLEGAL war on Iraq and sales of Dixie Chicks albums fall faster than Michael Jackson's offspring off the 13th floor balcony. Followed closely by death threats against them and their families, huge articles from editors of the lapdog media condemning them and a nation-wide radio blackout. What the fuck is up with that!!!??? Now I'm not a huge Dixie chicks fan but their last album sold 5 bazillion copies so don't tell me that 200 million people woke up overnight and realised their music was crap.   I can't stand the fact that Americans are willing to risk nuclear destruction, cold war, vietnam, bosnia and two world wars defending democracy and liberty when they are so keen to give up those exact same liberties themselves, inparticular i refer to free speech. Free speech - the right to disagree with your own governent and not be locked up. The right to protest openly about things you don't approve of or think are right. The right to free, open-minded, critically-minded media that will call the events of the day as they see it and not pander to any political agenda. The U.S government is doing a pretty handy job of reducing civil liberties in the form of terrorist-related constitutional reform. But by jingo's the american public is doing a much better job of taking away their own liberties with small-minded, red-necked and wide-spread social conciousness that says it is unpatriotic to criticise the government, a conciousness fed by both the media and the government. Boo mIchael moore at the oscars, don't watch martin sheen's tv show (even West Wing is the best thing on US TV), stone the dixie chicks, close your eyes and ears. I can't stand this behaviour in what SHOULD be an intelligent democracy. I hate it even more when the carry out wars trying to spread a doctrine that they themselves can't live by. Especially when the motives of the current government have been made as transparent as a cher ensemble. The average american is shitting me to tears because they are being lied to like the rest of us but they don't wanna know. End o' Beef  Just saw 24hr Party People and is was just so good. A really funny/tragic/cool movie, esp seen with an intelligent audience that knew why it was all so funny, or tragic, or important. vale ian curtis...	f
"And then there was dancing.  I had never driven into the city (Philly) on a weekend night before - and was unprepaired for the long time to find parking - and then to actually find where the dancing was.  It was on UPenn's campus - which I know close to nothing about.  There was some large event going on, so swarms of students were out and about - drunk.  I finally found the dance, found a corner to hide my stuff in, and found the guy who invited me to be there.  He needs a name... this new guy - 'cause its possible there will be more talk of him.  He interviewed me for a job a few weeks ago... at a political related organization (and yes - its leftist)... he's cute, he dances relatively well (not a hardcore lindy hopper, but a good lead for sure)... I'm interested... but he's of course not Mormon.  We'll call him Boss Man.  Yes, that's perfect.  It's fits swing lingo, politics, and how I met him.  So Boss Man was a good dancer, and pointed out a few people I should dance with.  I danced with a few more people who pointed out more people I should dance with. And thus the night continued.  I sat down for only a few songs - so i could breathe - and had to turn down about two people per dance I sat out.  Tiring - and more fun than I've had dancing in a looong time.  After dancing, ""the regulars"" go out to a local diner and eat.  Boss Man invited me, another guy, who was friends with Boss Man invited me, and yet again, a third guy invited me.  Success - when you dance well enough that you get invited to ""hang out with the dancers"" your first night in the new town.  And hanging out was a great time too.  There was a group of people from church there as well - I said hello to them, but otherwise was too busy dancing with people who knew what they were doing.  One tried to dance with me, but he was doing the country (wanna-be-a-swing-dancer) style where they have no rhythm, mave as fast as they can, and rip your arms out in the process.  I stopped - because I'm unwilling to let a guy hurt me - and  went back to dancing with real swing dancers.  The church people now believe me... I told them I can dance! :)  But this interest in Boss Man brings up all sorts of complicated issues, which I'll probably write about in my next post."	f

I find myself getting more involved with other peoples blogs. There are currently 2 blogs i take an active interest in. One's funny yet dramatic, the other's full of self searching. What's mine? Well, judging from previous posts, it appears that I seem to have too much gaming in my head!  Maybe I should cut down on the gaming posting and concentrate on my personal self. I guess maybe I haven't gotten to that stage yet. Here's a go:  I find Decision-making that affects my personal life is usually one of the hardest things to do. Why do I constantly attempt to pursue that which others believe to be impossible? Am I looking for drama to spice up my life? That's what comes when one reads too much or watches too many movies full of ideals, romanticism and hopes. Why can I not accept the norm, or go for that which is a safe decision? I cannot answer this, but I do know I cannot!  I will try... and I can only hope that the other will attempt the same...  Till then...	m
you make me come. you make me complete. you make me completely miserable. dont even try to turn it around now. i dont care enough to stay up crying and fight over it. ive been going over it and over it and i still cant figure out a why let alone a solution. my hair is flat and so are you.	f
Hello there the angel of my nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue, the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley, we can live like jack and sally if we want, where you can always find me and we'll have halloween on christmas and in the night we'll wish this never ends. well wish this never ends. I miss you...       where are you and I'm so sorry, i cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight i need somebody and always the sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every night. And as i stared i counted the webs from all the spiders, catching things and eating their insides. Like indecision to call you, and hear your voice of treason. will you come home and stop this pain tonight. .......................................... Yes bobbie i remember.....I always will.	m

Blurb This Terry by Chris Cardillo August 12, 2004  ·Manny is having another tremendous year, except when Ortiz is not batting in front of him.  So that’s why it makes sense to change that.  When Ortiz took his suspension, Manny’s rbi totals came to a standstill.  So why put Ortiz back in front of him?  We don’t want Manny winning the triple crown!  Why would we want that?  Seriously folks, Manny has been the clean-up for how long now?  I guess we should expect more out of a #4 guy, which is good reason for Terry to move him. ·Speaking of Francona, he looks like a cow chewing his cud and staring into nothingness waiting to be tipped. ·I still feel we should have gotten more for Nomar, but Meatsandwich is making some dandy plays out there. ·When Mueller almost got that close-up throw to his stomach last night, all I thought of was my recent spleen woes due to mono, and Mueller’s front side exploding like a balloon of blood.  I knew he shouldn’t be playing second base. ·I am not to blame for D-Day*.  Take me prisoner, torture me all you like, for the love of all that’s holy, it’s not my fault! ·Does anyone pay close attention to what Remy actually says?  A game last week, Meatsandwich was wrongly waved home, and would have been out by a mile.  Luckily the ball got by and he scored, but Remy reiterated a handful of times, good thing he was out by a mile, good thing he was out by a mile!  Seriously, is that a good thing?  Was he being positive?  Was he just hungry for a meat sandwich?  I don’t know, I personally feel he is a wacko. ·Listen to his counterpart Don Orsillo sometimes too.  He speaks WAY too fast.  Last week against the Tigers, the night Pedro pitched, Eric Munson of Detroit came up to bat for the third time.  Don says, “Munson flied out twice trying to bunt his way on.”  He meant he already flied out twice and now he is trying to bunt his way on, but damn slow it down!  I’m there thinking a pop out bunt happens regularly, but a fly out bunt?  Only original Nintendo’s Baseball Simulator was this possible, not real life.  I think I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt though, because I still believe RBI Baseball is real life. ·Speaking of RBI Baseball, my article this weekend will be a preview of CIMGW2004 (Crazy Iron Man guy Weekend 2004) and the adventures of DaEvns, McGwir, Gllrga, Strwby and Mldndo. ·I care more about how large my poop will be over how well Nomar is doing in Chicago. ·When people say the same thing enough times, you start to believe that as the truth.  All anyone says is the Red Sox will only ever win the Wild Card.  That drives me up the wall, what happened to the positive waves that used to flow around Boston?  The players hear what the fans say, and they believe it is impossible to win the division.  With 50+ games left, we are down less than 10, and 6 more games to sweep to boost us up, we only need to win a few more games against the rubbish of the AL.  Anyone else who believes like me should let me know I am not alone! ·Good thing we got the speedy Dave Roberts, who has not yet attempted a stolen base?  Great pickup! ·Terry used to take players out in the 7th inning.  Let me remind you it was only the non-essential players like Manny Ramirez.  Now that we actually have someone in Roberts whom is worth using as a pinchrunner, Terry refuses to use him.  It’s like having the choice of jumping your bloody self into a pool of sharks or joining an orgy with the Patriots Cheerleaders.  There is always the chance the cheerleaders will turn out to be brain eating zombies, but for Christ’s sake, let the boy give your grandmother a bath!  Maybe Panos Patakos never told Terry that Roberts is fast.  Or maybe he did, and Terry was too busy chewing his cud to listen. ·So I just pooped a one-footer. ·Speaking more of poop, I have a friend who once threw out his back while taking a monster growler. ·I wonder how my opinion of Terry is being portrayed.  The start of the season, I liked him.  The more the days pass, my stomach keeps turning, my hatred rising, I wonder if my drunken self can yell loud enough from the Fenway bleachers for him to hear me?  Only one way to find out!  And what do I care, I’ve been tossed in the first inning before.  That was not all my fault though, I blame our new friend Vodkarade, and his brother Vodkarade II. ·Vodkarade – Approximately 6 shots vodka mixed with whatever Gatorade is left in the bottle.  You’ll hear more of our friend in future posts.  Vodkarade may even be an official member of TEEF** soon. ·In closing – when Reese and Bellhorn are ready to return, who is going to disappear forever Craig Grebeck style?  Send me an email casting your vote, or post a comment!  I will reveal the totals next Tuesday morning.   *  D-Day – The Day that Alien who’s name begins with a D and is not to be mentioned molded himself into our lives.  ** TEEF – Tha Eastsidaz Extended Family	m
"our group bagged the grand prize in last year's summer presentation with this ""one in a million"" comedy, a parody of a pageant for overworked staff who have a knack for laughing at themselves, especially if it makes them look like complete idiots. this was a collaborative effort among the disgruntled beauties of the intermediate department.    opening number. choreography thanks to mattit. chona, alma, me, angie, mattit, sol, deb, eunice    four finalists. me, angie (conveniently hidden), chona, mattit    2nd runner-up chona on centerstage (we worked  soooo  hard on the script). judges are mrs. b and mrs. c    finale. crown is made of prop stars i kind of stole from shsj. scepter is a ladle  the entire presentation lasted around 20 minutes from opening number, interview portion (which was just insane! deb as the emcee and sol as interpreter. huge riot!). we were dressed in filipiniana tops and  baduy  shorts.  just looking back makes me laugh.  btw, check out the beach. it's on a small island off the coast of mactan. maribago bluewaters."	f

I must say that today has been rough. For one thing, I can tell you right now that I do not like Physics so far. But everything else is just fine. However, other then then not much homework at all, it is still a busy task to remember all my classes work.  Anyway, I hope to get all my work organized this weekend. So I hope by then, things in school will be a bit easier. I can tell you this though, I am loving Math this year. My math teacher, G-Dog as she calls herself, rocks. And the class is loads of fun, that and the work is really easy. Anyway, got to run! Later!    Wolfwood	m
Ok, when I first heard about this I thought that blogging (weblogging...keeping on online web log or journal) sounded really cool. I could write short little blurbs about what's on my mind and people who want to know me better could read them and amuse themselves at the insane and ever evolving processes of my mind...  I could recommend books and movies, say my piece about all of those shows that I am addicted to (you know, like those Survivor updates I always tried to do...), think aloud about al of the religious and philosophical debates that are floating around in my mind, and complain about things that bug me...Which is always fun to rant about.  And I freely admit that I am may be the biggest nerd ever...  So I found this website and decided to give it a go, and see if I can actually keep up with it. Unfortunately, I could not have picked a crazier week to begin, because unlike the series of boring, monotonous weeks that I usually pass through, this particular week had some amazing stuff going on...you know...those events that you look forward to for weeks? So how on earth do I begin when there are already major cool things I want to write about...such as the Madonna concert on Wednesday, seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on Friday on IMAX, and going to RELAY for life on Saturday and Sunday? I know...Unbelievable week, no?   For the sake of easier reading, I am going to do separate, short entries for each of those awesome things I did this weekend.   SO here it is, my first entry, and I think it went rather well, don't you?	f
Man, today was a pretty bad day all around, I guess.  I got up, and got to school on time (which is rare), and lasted through first period, chapel (in which Laura, Gwen and I led the pledges), and most of second, but during first break I was terrible. I have no idea why, but I suddenly felt all this weight upon my shoulders, and lost the will to do really anything. I just wandered around in a semi-daze for a while until third period (English, a class I really enjoy). Then I was fine again, and even happy and stuff, but then fourth (Computer 2); I hate that class with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I love doing anything computer related, but this class bugs the heck out of me for some reason. It's like I can never please the teacher or my peers. They come into it with some weird preconceived notion that I am inferior in all aspects of life, and don't waste any energy trying to contain their opinions. Plus the teaching methods are... intolerable. The teacher doesn't give ANY handouts or guides to ANYTHING (well, I must correct myself, he did give us a total of six, maybe seven sheets of paper this year - mostly pictures of what our projects are supposed to look like.), but makes us rely solely on notes. This would not be so bad if the guy could keep thinking on the same track for more than 26 seconds at a time. He continuously jumps around between topics, then doubles back and corrects himself, then stops to think for a minute, then cant remember what he was trying to say, and so, jumps to another random, entirely unrelated topic. (Does it seem like Im aggravated?)  Ne way, I had lost all resolve to so anything that period, and had just resigned myself to staring blankly at the monitor for the entire 45 minutes.    Lunch wasnt much better. Gwen was in a junior planning meeting for the upcoming retreat, so I couldnt talk to her. (Something I desperately wanted to do  I always, with maybe one exception, cheer up when Im conversing with her.)   Fifth period (typing) was almost as bad as fourth. The only thing I got accomplished in the entire class was a short sorrowful poem that I have yet to complete, name, and post. Sixth (pre-Calc  the hardest math course offered at our school for ones relative knowledge level at entrance) was also really bad. I got a hard test back, and found out I got a 6 out of 14 correct. That pretty much shot the rest of that period. I just laid my head in my arms and tried to shut the world out for a little while, with little success.   Sixth period, however, my mood changed drastically (maybe cause I was finally able to communicate with someone(s). For that class, Gwen sits on my right, and Rachael on my left. I spent all period talking to Rachael about intellectual stuff and to Gwen about how her day was going, and doing tons of work ahead cause I finally got back that derive to work that I had lost all day.   Once I got back home, I could tell immediately that something was at least slightly wrong with my mom. She didnt have that radiant air (spelling?) about her that she usually does around the time that I get home. Later that night, I found out what was wrong at another of our dreaded family meetings: My dad was going on another power trip and had decided sporadically that my mom could no longer be in contact with her best friend, my Aunt Darh-wynn. He was as inanely bull headed about it as he ever is, frustrating me and my sisters beyond measure, and pushing my mom to the brink of tears... again.   Yup, so all in all, today did pretty much suck.  O, and I found out that Gwens working on Sat. from 4-10, so I dunno if the movie idea will work out... So far what I had planned (on planning) to do was invite Gwen, Goody, Diane, Andrew, Cam, Josh and Rachael (Cam and I want her to meet Diane) over to my house, and then go from there to see a movie (most likely the Core, if its still out). But, since Gwen's working, we might end up doing the same thing, minus her, and then visit her later at work. Dunno, Im still thinking about it...	m
"Evil   HELP WANTED  Hey XTIAN, my nephew noticed the help wanted sign that you posted for becoming a writer on this blog. Dude, that kid meets all the requirements, man. And he's only 14 months old! He's got a lifetime of emotional closed-offness, struggles with food, and emotional scarring ahead of him. You wanna get in on the ground floor here. This kid is gonna be a star. Attached is evidence that he meets the requirements:    ""Emotionall closed off"" : This is a pic of me and him hanging out. We literally keep each other at arm's lenght. Also notice the giant box of Veniero's in the foreground. I sat there and ate no less than 1 dozen mini canolis. (Hey, they were mini!)  I think some of that rubbed off on the kid. See next pic...        ""Unhealthy relationship with food"" : No futher commentary needed.        ""Emotional scarring due to underloving parents"" : This is a pic of new nephew and his dad. Apprently, in that household, a crying baby is not really a crying baby. Instead, a crying baby is an excellent shield against the paparazzi."	m
"urlLink This   is so freaking hilarious. I've been meaning to post it on here forever and I kept forgetting. The first time we heard this, Lisa and I laughed our asses off- I revisit it every once in a while when I need a good giggle.       ""And I spit on your grrrrave!"""	f
"I thought I was being creative by referring to the wife as The Divine Mrs. M., but I think I just stole it from  urlLink this  guy. Maybe there's not an original thought in my head? Is this how George Harrison felt when he realized he piked the  He's So Fine's  tune for  My Sweet Lord . Oh, well, he got over it.  For a new blog; a new feature: A wine review.  The Divine Mrs. M. (I'm using it anyway) and I are not wine snobs. I do not subscribe to Wine Spectator. The most I read about wine are the little tags stuck to the shelves. If I can find something I like for $4, I'm buying it and serving it to my good friends. We do not buy wine at restaurants because it's hard to enjoy a wine when you know you've been screwed on the price. However, we do make a weekend of the  urlLink Cincinnati Wine festival  each year to try things we haven't before and get a little better education and we do live within walking distance of the riverfront wine oasis known as  urlLink The Party Source . While we have spent mucho dinero on wines in the past, we are now in a phase of finding hidden (cheap) treasures. Currently, this means walking into the Kroger liquor store and rummaging through the discount cart.  That's how for $7 we found  urlLink Obsession . A new grape to me - symphony - which is a cross of Muscat and Grenache. Another white after our long red only jag. We bought it because we had never tried the grape, but also because we like Muscat although not a big fan of grenache. We had it last night about 9 for a late dinner. We both had a large romaine and spinach salad with egg, tomatoes, bacon, and garlicly croutons. My dressing was full of onion flavor and this wine held it's own. First words are key to me: Mine was ""sparkly"" - not sparkling, but almost. It almost had the taste of a sparkling wine without the tickle that comes with those. Alicia said ""bright"". It was vibrant, but not sweet. Full mouthed, but light. A good wash down the throat to me and it stayed in the mouth longer than normal but not in a bad way. Very smooth finish. For a pairing, I would use medium flavors on light food, but I don't think it would stand up to anything robust. Nice salads, herbcious chicken would be good. We're going to see if there's any more in the discount bin."	m

Testing. Hope to god, well... I just hope that this one will work	m
so this will be the only real post of my Thanksgiving break. i haven't really had the urge to update this thing. not that nothing has been going on, just i wasn't sure how i'd like to portray whats going on in my life right now. so now we'll tackle some things that have been picking at my brain (however tiny it may be).   how was your holiday? mine really really sucked. well my aunt and uncle are getting married soon (not to each other, we aren't southern. southern little italy maybe) so they had their soon to be in-laws to have dinner with beforehand. this meant eating really late in comparison to normal family holidays. the entire family finally got together around 6 causing my grandpa and mom to become angered by the inconvenience. after the eating all those hostilities came out in full force resulting in a crying aunt and my grandfather pouting. just another sanders clan meal. but my night suprisingly was not a total loss. well i had invited amber to come along with me to this lovely dinner. smart me. somehow she was not completely phased by all this and hung out with me afterwards. that was about the best possible way my night could have ending, just being able to be with and talk to her was all i could wish for.   recently the effects of continuous change has been very prevalent in day to day life. it seems like a freakin blur. all the people around me are changing so quickly and i am no exception to this rule. i wouldn't say that we are growing up per say but we are all growing. at least i think that's what you'd call it. not that any of this is necessarily bad either. my life is really good right now but nothing is the same as it used to be a few short weeks ago. NOTHING AT ALL. some case examples would be:  -liz and everything that's going on in her life. that lazy kid i know has a job now! what the hell is happening. -tom used to be an easygoing, fun loving guy. seems like he's going through some bad times and i have no clue how to help him out... mitch was going through something similar but i think that's all passed.  -my relationship with amber is constantly evolving and getting stronger. 2 months ago i was just saying hello to the girl. it's been about a month from today that we've been dating. i haven't felt anything nearly this way about anyone ever.   ... and that's just how i see it.	m
I made the horrible mistake of going to bed too early.  I'm wide awake.  It's Christmas -- and I have to wait at least another 2 hours and 15 minutes to open presents.	m
"urlLink )""  title=""Comments by SquawkBox.tv""> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    Not much to blog about. Feeling quite lonely, and left out I suppose. I've realized recently, I don't have as many true friends as I thought I did, just acquaintainces, and that is something I've never really brought to my reality. Sad but true.  No headaches, for about 4 days now !!! Terrific news!!  I feel alot of pain because I'm not as close to certain family members. I think back and its not any different from being in Wichita. No phone calls, no letters. Although I do see this person once in a while, I don't really get to talk to her. I hate it. I want to be closer to someone in my family. I want to really feel like someone cares. I mean this person decided on a date for an important event, and where it was going to be, and didn't bother to tell me, but told everyone else. I hate feeling like an outsider. I want my own family. I want my own place in life.  I want my own place in this world. Although it is a world, I would never want to own up to. It is an angry evil place. I want to find the good in life. I want to go with what I truely believe, that most people are good. I want to see it for myself though.   Not sure what else to say...  Although I am bothered, because Calin said I seemed to be cold lately. And then he wouldn't explain himself. It makes my heart ache. Although it already does because I miss him so. I keep having this feeling, that we are wasting our time, and no matter what we do, we won't be together. I know that is my negativeness, but no matter how much I try and stay positive about out future that comes to me.  I just feel like curling up in a ball and crying right now. Feeling so alone, and lonely..  and not wanted...  I'm hurting alot inside.  I need to be held. I need to be loved.   One day I will find what I need."	f
Well today was dedicated to a trip to the University of Manchester, the recently combined Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST. The whole university sits astride Oxford Road - the busiest bus route in Europe - in the centre of the city. It doesn't feel remotely rural or suburban, but metropolitan from every angle. There's an interesting mix of very old and mid-20th century buildings, with no noticeably new ones. The university is fairly clustered, but very big.  The computer science building feels modern and is currently being refurbished. The school of computing is very highly regarded and rated, being the first one of its kind in the country. The facilities you'd expect are present and students I chatted with were positive about the place; all chose it as their first choice.   Noticably, there were more girls at the open day than boys (not a bad sign!), although the computer science talks had a predictable male attendance bias.  Accommodation was closed, but we went on a tour of it anyway and it seems similar to Birmingham. Self catered flats would still be my first choice I think. Interestingly, gap year students aren't put together like at Birmingham.  Tomorrow is a day off, and then monday is a trip to Nottingham.	m
Just went for a run. I think it's either the ice cream Venetta I've been eating these past few days taking effect on my fitness, or the weather is just getting cold, because I seriously had a slight problem running these past 2 sessions. After the run, I even felt a bit of cough coming up. Just took my grandma's remedy, 2 raw eggs. Justin and David were disgusted by it. Haha. Must admit lah, the initial taste is kinda hard to take down, but it gets better after that. Anyway, so long as it's effective, I don't mind the awful taste for a few seconds. Let's hope my stomache can take it tonight because I haven't taken this remedy for some years and I'm not sure of my stomache is used to it now. Well, maybe some water to help it go down later.  I emailed a complaint to the bus service and I'm hoping to get some kinda reply soon. But even so, I think I've cooled down enough to be able to forget it lah. Afterall, the thing is over already. Sigh ...  OK I gotta go work on my report liao. Final year project write up, ARGH!	m
For whatever reason in my family, we haven't grown up with many traditions. Maybe part of this reason is because we usually had to go out of town to visit family for holidays, but I'm not really sure. I've already decided that when I have my own family, we're going to have so many traditions that my kids are going to hate me. Okay, not really, but I think it's essential for kids to have some traditions. I'm also going to have family vacations every year. I guess that means I have to live somewhat close to my parents when I'm older so we don't have to go out of town to visit them all of the time.	f
"We had a typical morning.  Went to bank.  Went and ate lunch.  Paid the rent.  Asked Doc if he wanted to go play bingo, he said,""no."" So we went and got Fat Granny's paycheck.  At first glance, it looked like she had more money than she was supposed to.  We got to looking and that wasn't the case.  But it still had our minds 'active', nonetheless.  So, we go back to the bank- deposited her check and went home where something else dramatic happened...  It all started when She was watching Montel.  After the commercials came on, she came over to me and said, ""a man that lies and cheats will just keep lying and cheating.""  Keep in mind that she was talking to me. Well, sitting there on her computer Doc said, ""sick bitch."" Fat Granny didn't hear him; but I did.  Then Fat Granny said what she said again.  He said what he said again, mumbling.  She said, ""What are you saying?""  And he said very clearly, ""Your a sick bitch.""  !?!?!?!?  That was the closest I have ever come to cussing someone out in my life.  I took another walk around the complex with my cd player right after it happened.  I needed to 'chill'.  She doesn't deserve that.  She practically does everything for him, really.  Makes his coffee.  Buyes his cloths/food, etc.  Cooks every night.  Fixes plate.  Always thinking about him when we are out eating...  [he won't ever go with us]  She's been nothing but nice to him for years!  They had a very 'light' discussion.  She asked him to move out.  When she said that... He started apologizing like crazy.  Nuh-uh, jerk.  Un-acceptable.  So, he's leaving. And taking her computer with him; She gave it to him.  She's being all nice to him while he gets his things out... If it were me... But he did apologize to me too.  I didn't say anything, just kept walking through the front door.  How would you feel about someone if they called your favorite grandmother a ""sick bitch"" ?"	m
"This blog is dedicated to all those people out there who had an unrequited high school crush. Here is the embarrassing and retarded account of mine.     It was freshman year. I was sitting in my algebra class trying to be as much of a non-entity as possible, when my friend (let's call him Matt, since that is his name) came over to my desk began telling me really cheesy jokes. After about a minute one of the fellas sitting near me started to comment on it to his friend. ""He's always over here at her desk talking to her and stuff. I think he likes her or something,"" he said, much to my chagrin. ""Is this true Kayla? Does Matt like you?"" queried his friend in a not-so-much-of-a-friendly-inquiring-kinda-way-so-much-as-a-looking-for-a-way-to-embarrass-you-type-of-way. ""I don't know,"" I mumbled. ""He's always over hereacting dumb and stuff."" At which point Matt clams up, gives me a look, and goes back to his desk.   And that was it... my magic moment. Withthe little seedplanted by those weenie guys, I was head over heels in love.   So for the next4 years I was love sick and dopey. I wrote horrible poetry. I analyzed and reanalyzed every comment he made to me, every look, every sigh. I joined activities I never woud have ifMatt hadn't been in them. I had it bad. We had two overnight meetings for an activity we were both involved in called Academic Decathlon. Both times we went, I stayed awake almost all night just to watch him sleep. One year we were there I wrote this terrible ""stream of conciousness"" type poem about how much I wanted to fixthe holes in his socks and sew up his backpack. Oy!   Now that I've told you how braindead and loopy I was,I'm sure you can relate to the awfulness I went through when I had to sit through every conversation about the girls he liked, the girls who didn't understand him, the girlswho did him wrong. All the time I was sitting there all I could think was ""WHY NOT ME?!?""The worst it ever got was when we wentto a birthday party for a mutual friend at our local park. Matt met a girl who struck his fancy. She had been throwing up shortly before he decided to go make out with her in the ball field. So I, being the ever mentally stable person I was then, decidedto punish myself for being so awful that a perfect strangerwho had been throwing upwas a better choice than myself as a makeout buddy, byslashing the hell out of my wrist with a soda can. Worry not, it wasn't serious. Mostly just deepish scratches but it hurt like a mother.   Senior year came to a close. Matt signs my yearbook with something along the lines of ""We've bothmeant more to each other than either of us will ever admit."" What the hell?!Anyways, I went off to college and continued to write him letters and email allthat first year with him replying and coming to visit me at home at Christmas. After that he dropped off the face of the earth and I didn't hear anything else about him for about4 years, by which time I had scoured the internet and found the man of my dreams and married him. I was pretty much over Matt by then... heehee. I spoke to him about a year ago and in my inebriated state told him about my crush on him. He claimed to have been oblivious. I don't know how... everyone else I knew was very aware of it.   So as you know if you bother to read my blog at all, my reunion is coming up at the end of this week. Hopefully Matt and is lovely wife Lori will be there. Also hopefully, he won't have read this and told his wife about it. I'd really have to die of embarassment. Oh well... I plan to drink before going, so maybe after a few cocktails there I just won't care even if it is brought up.   So there is my tale of love and woe. I hope yours is just as goofy and makes you feel as stupid as mine does."	f
"Nick drove towards town, glancing from time to time at the blonde in the back.   ""Where are we going, Mrs. Davis?"" ""My husband is renovating a house outside of town.  An investment.  I want to go by and see how it is coming along.""  Nina casually opened her purse, pulling out a compact.  After a cursury check of her hair and makeup, she snaps it shut.  ""Turn left here"".  Nick pulled the long, black car down the winding driveway to a small house.  It was delapitated and grey, set out amidst acres of green pasture land.    ""Park behind the house"". Nick came to a halt behind the house, in a yard of overgrown weeds choking the remains of a rusted swingset.  Nick quickly accessed the house and the condition.  No renovation had been done on this claptrap since before Nick was born, and he became increasingly aware that this was not a casual ride.  ""Mrs. Davis,"" he scolded lightly, ""you have not been honest with me.  No one is renovating this house.  So, why are we here?""  ""You caught me.  I just wanted to be alone, I guess.  It is so peaceful here.  And private.""  Nina stretched in the back seat.  It had not occurred to her that her ruse would be seen through this easily.  Or this quickly.  Shit, she thought, this one is smarter than all of the rest.  Put together, actually, she surmised.  Perhaps the direct approach would be best.  ""Nick, would you be so kind as to join me in the back seat? I need to talk to you.""    ""So talk, I can hear.""  Nick studied her increasing discomfort in the rear view mirror.  Did she really think he was going to climb back there and fuck her without question?  Sure she did.    ""Nick, I would like to be able to talk to you and stare at something besides the back of your head.""  Nina pouted prettily.  Is this bitch nuts?  Nick is thinking that he should start the car and drive.  Trouble in the backseat, trouble at work.  Shit, trouble every fucking place he went.  Stopping his musing, he noticed that Mrs. Garrett damn Davis was busy unbuttoning her dress.  On the other hand, he thought as he viewed her satin and lace bra, there is no harm in having fun with the high and mighty.  Nick grinned and got out of the car.  Instead of walking around to open the back door, Nick strolled over to a large tree behind the rusty aluminum shed.  Leaning against it, he lit a cigarette and started counting until she came out of the limo.  Twenty one...twenty two...twenty-  Nina Davis threw open the door of the car.  Stepping out on the dirt drive, she straightened herself up with the dignity of a queen.  She has balls, Nick grudgingly thought.  She strode over to him, looking up at his sunglasses.  ""Take those off,"" Nina demanded.  Nick pulled of the shades and folded them up, tucking them into his pocket.   ""Do you realize that I could have you fired?""  Nina glared at the insolent man before her. ""And?"" ""And?  You work for me, and when I ask you to do something..."" ""I work for your husband, and I doubt very much that he wants me to play footsie in the back of his limosine with his wife."" ""My husband could care less."" Nina spat. ""Then he is a fool.  What exactly is it that you want from me, Mrs. Davis?""  Nick stared into her sapphire eyes. Nina found herself unable to answer the direct question.   ""Nina, do you want me to drive you around?  Or do you want me to fuck you until you are completely satisfied?  Do you even know what complete sexual satisfaction feels like?""  Nick purred at the woman.  The prey had become the predator, and Nina forgot all about Garrett's plans, the camera recording the empty back seat and everything else.  All she knew was that at that moment, she had to have this man.  No matter what.  Nick put his hand behind her neck, bracing her, as he eased open the front of her wrap dress.  Nina did not move, or speak, afraid that the merest whisper would deter Nick from the plan of action she saw in his face.  Nick unhooked the front of her bra, lowering his head to her breast.  He traced the nipple with his tongue, watching it harden under his touch.  No, he thought, as he sucked on the taut breast of his employer's wife.  No soft seduction for you, my lady.  Nick picked up the woman and carried her to the car, laying he on top of the hood.  She moaned, and Nick tore her satin panties off.  His hand reached between her legs, his fingers gently stroking her to complete heat, total submission.  He pulled open his jeans, thrusting into her roughly and instinctively.  Her gasp on entry soon turned to cries of complete abandon as he drove into her, never stopping for caress or kiss.  It was completely animal and instinctive.  He held himself back, watching the lovely woman writhing underneath his possession of her.  Her back arched and she screamed in ectasy, pure wanton grace of lust.  He grasped her hair, thrusting deep and held her up to his chest as he came, exploding in satisfaction as she trembled at the force of his orgasm.      Nick turned her chin up, looking at her.  She stared into his eyes, and he grinned at her, completely amused.    ""Was that what you wanted to talk to me about, Mrs. Davis?"""	f
Ok so I still don't have hot water at my new home....UGH!  So this morning I got up around 6:50 so I could leave and shower at a friend’s house.  And let me tell you it was the BEST shower ever!  He had this cool showerhead so it was like I was showering in the rain.  Oh I liked it a lot!  Can't wait to go back tomorrow, yes tomorrow and possibly Friday. We called on Tuesday to get the gas turned on, but they said it would be Friday before it would be on.  Also still no cable or Internet, sooooooo makes for a lovely night of unpacking, but it's ok because I have vodka and grapefruit soda now!! LOL. Oh that reminds me.  Yesterday was my grandma's 78th birthday!!  Happy Birthday Grandma.  She is in town and so I went out to my parents’ house in the Wood to celebrate last night.  My dad grilled since we didn't on Memorial Day because I was all movin and shit.  But anyway my Grandma is funny because she is deaf in one ear, and I always forget which one and end up having a conversation with the wrong ear...lol.  Anyhow for her present I got her a little picture frame thing that would match her bedroom AND because she loves cheap alcohol........I bought her a 4-pack of fuzzy navel wine coolers.  She was very excited and got a kick out of it.  She gets silly drunk off of like 2, and it is very fun to watch.  So I provided entertainment for us all by giving her the wine coolers. Hee hee. Ok well back to me.  I am at work Hella early today!!  I know it's hard to believe, but I got to work around 8:20!!  For those who don't know I'm usually not here till like 9:20.  So yay for gettin some extra time in!  Ok well I am off for now; I must get my morning caffeine before I have absolutely no focus what so ever.  Bye for now.	f

"Together, Apart  I live in a country where independence is a top priority.  We urge each other to ""not let him/her hold you back"" and advise ""you have to look out for yourself!""  We listen to Christina Aquillera tell us ""you can hold us down"" and the Dixie Chicks warbling on about Wide Open Spaces.  We want out, we want  up, we want to be on top where no one can reach us.  We seek sucess without the help of others; happiness wihtout the need for companionship. But today I wonder- why?  There is the answer we all know from deep within, where fear has carved a place for itself in our hearts.  To love, to give, to be part of a whole is to risk great pain.  Pain that could, and for many of us has, drive us into the ground.  Pain that could take years to get over and pain that just doesn't seem worth it.  We fear interdependence. But think of the songs that make you CRY every time, or at least the first fifteen times  you heard it.  ""When you say nothing at all"" by Allison Krauss.  ""Candle on the Water,"" Pete's Dragon.  ""All because two people fell in love,"" some country singer. These are the songs that fill your heart with hope and make you think ""Wow, maybe someday I can mean that much, I can be that important.  Maybe someday I will be part of the whole.""   And yet, we strive for independence.  We turn others away.  We move away from each other and we get divorced.  I am caught, and I venture to say that my country is caught, in a tug of war.  I want, so badly to matter.  I want to be loved.  I want the sight of me to cause others to smile.  Yet, I want to be free and to be my own person.  You can have it both ways, but I'm not sure how.   In my life I have had many a great person love me.  My family contains nine of the greatest people.  Stefani and Mark.  Jen S and Jenn O.  So, so many people.   And through these interactions and relationships I have become more able to love the world, myself and others.  What have I gotten from turning away the help of others?   There are no answers to these questions that I can think of. They are just the ponderings of November 20th, 2003."	f
"The Author-Centered Approach  Dr. Cunningham gave me a copy of  urlLink an article  today that I found intriguing.  In this article Robert Stein, former professor of Southern Seminary said, ""I want to know what they [the biblical writers] meant, not treat the biblical text as kind of an inkblot that each one of us, with good imagination, sees something in it.""  This article discusses an approach to hermenuetics that is author-centered, as opposed to ""textus classicus me-centeredus."""	m

Drama. Not too much drama, but enough to hurt your stomach a little; that’s how my weekend ended and my week started. If I could, I would wave a magic wand and all would be right  good in the world. As it is, I can only sit on my hands, make phone calls (wait for them to call me back) and pray that all will be OK in the end. Even though I’ve been calling to try to help, I think I’m just adding to the stress of the situation. I hate being so far away during these tough times. If only I were rich enough to take off for about a month to help out. Perhaps in my next life . . . And yet I feel so helpless even though I know there’s pretty much nothing I can do from here. I’m frustrated, very, very frustrated.  On a livelier front, Cacky will be coming in this Friday for her birthday weekend in NYC! We have a few activities planned, but nothing too major as Chris will have to go to work early Sunday morning (7 am). We have plans to go out to dinner, an Irish pub, shopping and, of course, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. Everything else is pretty much up in the air.  I would write more, but I’m afraid I’m a bit preoccupied and can’t seem to grab hold of a complete thought, so let’s just make comments on today’s news! I’m sure by now everyone has heard about the California lawyer who was shot at point blank like 5 times. Amazing video! Talk about a disgruntled client! On Sunday, I watched Sean “P Diddy” Combs run the NYC marathon. He ended up raising over $2 million for NYC schools so I can’t really shoot down his efforts as just another publicity stunt. In truth, I like P Diddy – his music and most other of his business ventures. He seems like a stand up guy anyway. And in case you haven’t heard, Minnie Driver (the actress) is planning to work in a Cambodian sweatshop in order to help improve working conditions and pay for people in poor countries. She’s planning to bring a photographer along and they’re hoping to make a documentary or write a book about the ordeal. OK, so now I have to question whether she’s doing this for poor people or poor Minnie.  In case anyone would like more blogs to read, there is one (www.bigwhiteguy.com) in which this Canadian white male who is now living in Hong Kong recounts his adventures of living in a city where the “tax rate is unbeatable” and he sees “things most people on dream of seeing.” This site was featured on CNN and is good to read in case you just don’t have enough to fill your day. Yes, I say live vicariously through the Big White Guy!! Why not? It’s cheaper than going there yourself! Ok, now off to order Chinese food from Chef Ho Dumpling House!!	f
Eu te amo porque te amo.      Não precisas ser amante,   e nem sempre sabes sê-lo.      Eu te amo porque te amo.      Amor é estado de graça   e com amor não se paga.     Amor é dado de graça,    é semeado no vento,   na cachoeira, no eclipse.      Amor foge a dicionários   e a regulamentos vários.      Eu te amo porque não amo    bastante ou demais a mim.      Porque amor não se troca,   não se conjuga nem se ama.   Porque amor é amor a nada,   feliz e forte em si mesmo.     Amor é primo da morte,    e da morte vencedor,   por mais que o matem (e matam)   a cada instante de amor.	f

"the funniest thing happened to my friend from work. ben went to get a hair cut and his usual barber was packed, so he decided to try a new place in queens.  when he entered the establisment he noticed it was only other men,  after asking for aa trim they seated him right away.  he sat down and a light went on in the mirror....it was a two way mirror with scantaly clad women on the other side wow he thought, thats wierd and gross and arousing all at the same time.  just as the barber was done he heard a racket coming from out side then all of a sudden the cops bust in, in a raid.  ben politley asked a cop if he could go, the cop said ""kid ya just got a free haircut""  man what a boring weekend i did absolutly nothing....well i wrote 2 half songs so i guess being traped without a vehicle isnt too terible."	m
"""The naked truth is always better than the best-dressed lie."" ~Ann Landers    Dictionary.com defines Pretentious as Claiming or demanding a position of distinction or merit, especially when unjustified.  Yesterday, Matt and I were talking about the ethics of being a Prostitute.  It all came up when we were talking about the fact that I keep having repeated dreams about Amsterdam and CooCoo-Clocks.  Anyway, he asked me if I believed Prostitution is unethical.  I told him that I didnt think it was necessarily unethical, that it was a business like any other.  If a woman chooses to sell her body like a T-bone thats her prerogative.  That being said, I DO have Religious issues with ita topic for another day.  It got me to considering all of the things in this world that may claim the title Pretentious.  Escort services and Vegas Nude shows top my list.  I have to say that I have far more respect for Prostitutes and Strippers than I do for Escorts and Vegas Dancers.  Of all the things in the world, being a Stripper cuts out the glorified mask.  If a woman says, Im a stripper you really dont have to wonder what she does, shes not trying to pretend shes something that shes not.  On the other hand, if a woman tells you shes a Dancer in a Las Vegas Nude show then shes trying to hide the fact that she takes her clothes off for money behind fancy costumes, sequins and boas.  Its ridiculous!  Likewise, if you find out that a woman is a hooker, you know what she does for a living and shes not trying to hide it.  If she says she an escort you know shes really a prostitute in disguise!    Now I realize that it is socially acceptable and politically correct to be Pretentious, but what the HELL!  Several other things that top my list of annoyingly pretentious are: Lap dogs that parade as cats, local bands who think theyve made it big because they made a CD on their Karioke machine, fad lesbians, and Democrats!  ~Kristyn"	f
"As my script was running through gigabytes of data, spitting some weirdly encoded information, I was feeling very bored to sit staring at the monitor and running commands like  ""ps x"", ""ls -lh some_arbitrarily_long_path"", zmore some_zip_archive  etc  for the umpteenth time just to see if the process (also me) is alive. Just then I got reminded that my friend had asked me to buy something from M.G. Road. Wow! What a wonderful reason to go to M.G. Road.   The timing could not have been more apt, it was 5:30 PM and a gentle drizzle had just stopped making the setting perfect. I walked along the pavement gazing at the huge buildings (believe me!), crossed the Mayo Hall and Symphony Cinema Hall and finally reached the opticals shop, all the while watching people and listening (no deliberate over hearing) to all the languages spoken in Bangalore. The crowd primarily consisted of young couples  with dreamy eyes walking hand-in-hand, making hush-hush statements in mostly English. I was wondering if English is the  lingua franca  of 'modern day' Love or if these couples don't have a common native tongue.  I bought the contact lens cleaning solution and was returning back to my office on the opposite pavement. Long after the end of the 'colourful' Brigade Road area, my eyes caught the sight of a bright young couple standing in a place unusual for such meetings. The girl appeared to be highly animated, so I stopped for a while and watched. Having been exposed only to the good old Doordarshan and having been forced to watch every program relayed by them on Sundays including the 'News for the hearing impaired', I could recognise the sign language she was using. Oh! I realised that either the girl is dumb or the boy is deaf or both. The question I had about the language of Love is long gone from my mind as I walked back to my office ..."	m

"i am feeling a mix of emotions as my dateline for my assignment approaches... it's tomorrow anyway. And i have yet complete 1 final task.... out of 6 fucking tasks... it took me almost a friggin month to reach where i am but it's not good enough. It is seriously pissing when things do not get done... So fucking frustrating. You spent shite load of time, reading, studying, doing the exercises, yet the output is not exactly as productive as you thought. This is shite. It is also a surprising fact that i am also catching the movies tonite... boy, talk about shooting myself on the foot.   I dun know... i was having this short chat with a fellow blogger yesterday and somehow what surprised me was when she mentioned a statment which i thought was uncalled for. she said, ""well, problems come and go, unlike you *."" I was surprised...i am like, ""why do u have to compare yrself with me? does it make you feel better this way by putting someone down? i didn't really agree with what she said so i asked her what made her feel this way, she said, ""Oh, from my senses and what * agrees too."" Oh yeah. so together with another fellow blogger, both of u you feel the same way about me. Well, from what she implies, 'from her senses' i supposed she form her opinion and impression of me through all the conversations we had. and maybe she was a bad day yesterday therefore, the conversation was a tad bumpy... it didn't flow well at all. I mean she told me she hardly visit my site coz i am writing the same old stuff everytime she visits... whereas she has too much to write... well, so be it then... why the comparisions again? i feel that she's trying to be someone who's icy and almighty.. the kind of image she wanna potray is similar to the gal, Julia Stilts in ""10 things i hate about you"". She doesn't give a damn about anything whatsoever and being hard to get and stuff, it's like trying to be a feminist with an attitude... I mean why all the dramatic persona? even her blog, she is putting words like ,"" in my icy tone"".... and the most prominent indication has to be her title of the blog... but of course, i ain't gonna mention it here. Well, therefore, i made it a point to be a pain as well in my replies with her. I was adopting the same tone of response as her..very curt and blunt. trying to be 'almighty' myself. I really didn't like our conversation at all... In a way it is sad becoz i always thought she can be a really nice friend but i guess...people comes and go and especially with the internet.. to lose a friend is as easy as erasing the words from yr notebook... once it's gone, it's gone... you write it over with something else.   Well, enough of the bitching here... after much cooler thoughts and calmer sense of mind, i figure that she might be having a bad day that's all and it's alrite if she think of me this way. To each is own. Hopefully, the next time round, she'll be having a better day."	m

"I used to think that polling just ""ruined the surprise.""  This was when I was very young and didn't know much.  I now know that polling is absolutely necessary along the way to see who's winning. It's very much a political scoreboard.    The American Research Group is my favorite site for polling information.  I've been following it since early in the primaries.  The following site www.americanresearchgroup.com/presballot/ will take you to the most recent ARG poll.    This information shows that that with Nader in the race, Kerry has 47%, Bush has 44% and Nader has 3% of the vote.  Okay, so this is a statistical tie.  Without Nader in the race, it's a point more for Kerry, but still statistically tied.    I don't get Ralph Nader!  The man is apparantly out to get the Democratic Party.  The statement that he is trying to get his message out doesn't hold water anymore!  He's run two times prior to this.  He knows that he isn't going to win and doesn't have a prayer of finishing with a respectable second.  It just makes me mad."	m
"I just read  this  and found it pretty sad. This kid wants to go kill Muslims. That's it, kill Muslims. God I hope they don't let him into any branch of the armed forces, just what we need, some kid with his own Muslim killing agenda. This is sad on so many levels it's not even funny.   Normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it. Normally fear that these people aren't actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can. How many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems...not alot, because they know they are secure in their job and aren't afraid that someone that isn't acclimated to the culture and can't speak the language well is going to come and take their job away. As far as I'm concerned if you can be replaced by someone that can't speak English and only just got here then you probably didn't deserve your job in the first place.   I also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals. I'm sorry but you can't go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next. Illegals work harder for less money than most of this country, they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place. They embody free market capitalism, they risk everything for a shot at a better life, and they are willing to work hard for it. And because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables. I don't hear anyone complaining about that, you never hear anyone say ""Damn those illegals, these oranges should cost 10 times this much!!!"".   The funny part of it is that we, as a country, support the illegals every day. If you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it. Do you shop at Walmart? Guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals.   Just like my answer to anything you don't like in our society, if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott. If you don't like illegals then don't buy anything they pick, shop anywhere they clean, or pay them for anything. Personally I don't care about illegals, like I said, I know they aren't taking my job. And I'm pretty secure in knowing that most Americans are too lazy, stupid, and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal ""problem"" so all they will keep doing is talking shit.   Another thing I love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on Earth just because they are born here. I'm sorry, but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they don't deserve to live here. I've got news for you kid, no one born deserves to live here, some of us are just lucky. And before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party I have to ask you, what have you done to make this country great? People go on and on about how great this country is, and I don't disagree, this is a great country, but it's not through their actions that it's great. It's thanks to people like Thomas Edison, The Wright brothers, and, thought I REALLY hate to say it Henry Ford that this country is great. It has nothing to do with John Q. Asshole that does alot of talking but doesn't do shit worth talking about, every country has those. Until you do something worth talking about I don't really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldn't because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the U.S. to maintain it's dominance in the world. It always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them."	m
One of the hardest things that we have to deal with is our own demons. Our demons are born every time we do not know or refuse to deal with something terrible that happens in our lives. Often times we choose to ignore them-pretending that they do not exist because their arguments are too heavy and difficult to deal with. We pretend that everything is alright and drown them in alcohol, drugs or whatever poison you choose. But in one way or the other they manifest themselves in different ways that other people can see except you. And you wonder why people react the way they do towards you, do the things you do and that you can’t seem to get what you want and truly deserve. Sometimes the most difficult person to see is yourself. Blinded by denial, self-pity, anger and fear, we can’t accept our own faults because it hurts too much to face them and that we have no clue on how to deal. We think it’s easier to turn our backs, unaware that we are sinking deeper into the black hole that we created for ourselves. And we slowly but so surely hate ourselves-letting self-loathing consume us. The light within us that once provided warmth and comfort is starting to fade. We become lost. So we start on the path towards self-destruction. We figure that if we didn’t care-things would be easier. If we numb ourselves enough-nothing can ever hurt us, thus becoming untouchable-or so we thought. We unintentionally or intentionally isolate ourselves and we then experience unbearable loneliness.  Concerned friends and family may tell you things that you refuse to hear because people, more often than not, do not like to be criticized. We can be very stubborn sometimes and we would rather be on the right than on the wrong. Also, no one else knows ourselves better than we do so why should we listen? Listen, because sometimes they actually know better. As much as I hate to admit it, they can actually see things better because they are not as emotionally involved the way we are. It doesn't necessarily mean though, that they are always right. Only we can truly know what is right for ourselves. We can always listen, weigh their reasoning and choose to either heed their advice or not. Emotions can cloud judgment and it’s the alarm that triggers our defense mechanism. And once they’re up, they become a barrier that no one can ever break down. The voice ofour demons drown the advice of our friends.   No one can ever help us except ourselves. It’s a struggle to rid the demons we ourselves created. It’s a choice on whether we choose to remain in pain and denial or to acknowledge our faults and decide to change. It’s not an easy process and we always run the risk of falling back into our old ways. Still, no matter how many times we stumble and fall, we must hold on to the belief that we can be better, we deserve a better life and that we can in fact, be happy. If we believe something strongly enough, it can come true.	f
I had two of my finals today, LA and Math... They were both fairly easy, I kind of went blank on some of the math problems though.

One landed on my desk, it was pretty gross.   Since the school year is over, I have all my tv/computer time back... So, I'll be on a lot more now.

"So as of today I've offically been away from Korea a month.  I can't say I really miss it that much.  There are things I miss though.  I miss the social aspects, the girlfriend and circel of friends.  And I miss knowing where everything is and having my own room night after night.  But it'll all be there when I get back (at least I hope so).  Today the bus ride I was worried about really wasn't all that bad.  I've gone crazy reading lately and read most of the way here.  I finished ""What color is your parachute.""  Great great book.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a job.  I also picked up a knock off copy of a Dhali Lama book called, shit I can't remember.  Anyway it deals with finding happiness and how he thinks this is possible and whatnot.  I'm not blown away by it but it's good.  It was co-written my a shrink and there is too much of him and not enough of the DL in my opinion.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I have to say Vietnam is a stunningly beautiful country.  It really sunk in on the way here.  Everything is so green and vibrant.   The city I'm right now is rather small but seems quite nice.  I should be meeting some girls I met on the bus for drinks in like 30 minutes or so.  This will beat a Saturday night of sitting in my room.  I think I'll take a small tour tomorrow and then go shopping.  This place is famous for making clothes at cheap prices.  One lady quoted $25 for a custom made suit.  I'll have to look into that.

"It snowed last night!  For those of you who do not live in Western Washington (state), this is very unusual, especially for March.  While I was eating breakfast this morning, the phone rang and I was foolish enough to think it might be my school calling to tell me school was late.  Unfortunately, it was my babysitter letting me know that she was sick and couldn't watch baby boy today.  So my morning, which is always a little crazy, just got a little crazier (by the way, I  love  my babysitter and in no way blame any craziness on her.  She is awesome and can't help getting sick.  I just like to complain).    I quickly called my parents and they said they'd take the baby today (they, too, are awesome people).  This means in the space of 10 minutes I need to pack his meals for the day (I always pre-package everything when he stays at my folks), throw some toys in the diaper bag, get his clothes out of the dryer, iron my pants, brush my teeth, and pack my lunch. As I leap up from the table, leaving the remainder of my breakfast untouched, I hear the one sound guarenteed to throw this already impossible plan out of whack.  That's right... the baby woke up early.  Scratch earlier plan.  Run upstairs to rescue baby from crib.  Dress him in ragamuffin-like, too-small clothes.  Swipe toothbrush through mouth once or twice.  Run back downstairs with baby and set him on the floor to play while I pack his meals (and mine).  At this point in my little story you may be asking yourself, ""Is she a single parent?""  The answer is no, but my husband is so not a morning person that I might as well be one in this case (he's the night owl and is great when the baby wakes up at 2:30 am though).  So, I manage to get everything together, in the car, and get on the way when I happen to glance at my gas gage.  Shit!  It's almost empty.  Normally, I would just push it and come coasting into the driveway on fumes, but as luck would have it, we have a PT appointment this afternoon.  Now a stop at the gas station is required.    We're finally on the road.  The good news is that traffic is pretty light which is just about a miracle considering it snowed earlier and I live in the Seattle area.  I get to my parents, drop off the baby, make it to school only to find out that I have a meeting and I completely forgot about my tutoring student.    No wonder it's only half way through the day and I'm already wiped out.  Did I mention that the caterpillars for our butterfly unit came two weeks early so I'm now frantically planning for that..."	f

Self-esteem, for me, seems to come and go. Almost as cyclically as depression (which, mercifully, I haven't suffered from in quite some time).  Sometimes my self-confidence shifts multiple times in a day. It depends what I'm doing, who I'm with...if I am working on something and accomplishing a lot, I feel very self-confident and proud. Somehow that all spills over to my body image and I feel better about myself. Probably more realistically about myself--because I am my own worst critic.  If I am with someone romantically I can easily feel good about myself, if not great about myself. Love is quite a tonic. There was a bit on  Xena  earlier on in the show's life, wherein Xena tells Gabrielle (paraphrase) that she can only believe in herself when someone else believes in her, first. Written out like this it sounds rather sad, but I can relate to that. Having someone fancy me makes me feel like maybe I'm decent human being material after all.	f

Tomorrow I have to see a play. Isn't that supposed to be happy, Dimi? Wont it be, Alex? No, not at all. I really don't think I'll even like it. Not because of the play, I love plays. I love acting. Pretending I'm someone else is why you're here, isn't it Dimi? Yes, I suppose, but I can't be you all the time, Alex.	m

I just had an amzing time at skate X 2 bad the rest of the group missed it i have to thank my dad for insisting i should go though i really should question his motives after all, what is more dodgy that mum was away at cub camp (lol) anyway back to my story... I was on the mini first I got my frontside axle stall transfers down perfect, and also my disasters are like 100% now. Then I tryed frontside axles on the sides and I have got them too (but not too consistant cos it scary droppin in not seeing lol) I also manged to get my tail stalls right and this has done wonders to my runs on the mini. before i was quite slow and could only transfer like once lol after this for some reason I decided to try some proper spins I landed decent 360's which i am quite pleased with and also a few other people seemed to be impressed with. yey i feel good with myself.   My brother though is spending all the time he can get on my board and it is really gettin on my nerves because when i want to skate i find he has nicked it. Though i have to give it to him he probably will get kickflips before me (though thats all he does these days is practice them) he has the technique that i cant master why why does my foot fall down unable to pull back (I blame being able to kick myself in my head lol)  I wish I had gone to skate extreme yesterday though i would have gone had i known rhys would have been there. well next time BOTR meet i really do need to get some footage including of me and in particular of neil. When shall we meet at skate x next i might not have money to go wednesday but i will try. Dats all from Jon cyaz peeps	m
"I have some ideas, I want to begin makeing some short flicks for fun but the ideas I have are a little bit segestive, but what the fuck am I saying eveythings segestive. I want to record my 87 year old Nana, not to make fun of her but I want to film her doing her everyday things but...( When ever I see my Nana I have have ths constant felling she will kill over eny minut, and it scares the shit out of me. I had an incident whare I was in the liveing room and I turn my head just in time to see something fall. I thought it was my Nana, I thought she finally died. I stood still for about 5 minuts before I had to look she didnt fall a bag of dog food fell she was in her room doing god knows what but it was scary)...There are meny incidents whare you thing she just died but every time we discover someway or another she dousnt. Then whan you think the movie is about over and shell be fine we see a quick shot of her dead on the floor. Ill expand on it a bit more but thats the jif of it in a nut shell. Then I also had a funny one whare you see a bunch of homeless familys and starving children and play the music ""you cant always get what you want"" or some other silly music.

One topic I’ve noticed on the forums more and more lately is people touting themselves around for backers.  Can’t blame them for trying but the only answer I can give is short and sharp : “Yeah I bet you’d rather play with my money than your own.  Ain’t gonna happen though !”	m
Yup, I'm at Sherri's now.  Got here at about one this afternoon.  I watching her beat RE0 and talking to Rachel on the phone.

"urlLink ContraCostaTimes.com 07/23/2004 Ronstadt gets audience walkout encore : ""Posted on Fri, Jul. 23, 2004        Ronstadt gets audience walkout encore       By Bonita Brewer   CONTRA COSTA TIMES    LIVERMORE - Linda Ronstadt's political message sent close to a hundred concert-goers home early Thursday evening.  What had been a mellow evening at Wente Vineyards, with the crowd even serenading her with 'Happy Birthday' at one point, turned into a rush for the exits by some fans angry by her encore tribute to filmmaker Michael Moore.  'She just had to do it,' one fan steamed as he headed for the parking lot. 'It was good until the end,' another yelled to TV crews waiting outside the concert.  'She's getting out of line; it's ridiculous,' said Cindy Williams of Livermore, as she left during the last song of the evening.  Ronstadt's encore dedication of the song 'Desperado' to Moore, the controversial maker of 'Fahrenheit 9/11' who she described Thursday as 'a great American patriot,' got her booted from a Las Vegas casino Saturday and drew cheers, some boos, and a few 'traitor' yells from the Livermore crowd.  Until that last song, the concert had been an evening of good music and happy fans."""	m

I missed mass last night. I thought it was at 6:30. Apparently, it was at 5:30. It matters not. I still went down to the tracks with them. Rhonda was hoping to see Allison's mom there, because she's actually speaking out now, trying to educate people about the dangers of railroad tracks. After, we went into Dairy Queen. It was fun just to hang out with those guys. I miss Jason and Clayton. They're fun guys. Clayton is working at Boston Pizza still. Jason is in college. Who's have thought he'd be the first one there? Actually, it makes sense, because he's really the only one who knows exactly what he wants to do. I got my Kiros pics back today. They should be in the SHOW REVIEWS section of my page later today. Go check right now to see!!! Afterwards, I went back to Crystals. It was a good night. Sometimes I like nights like that, too.   urlLink  postCount('2002november2');	m
So today was ok. We were going to visit my brother at his office and bring him some lunch but that didnt work out because he had no money and he had a lunch from home anyway. Maybe you people will come visit me tomorrow when I work. That would be nice   So then Catie im-ed me about going out to lunch with Kathryn and Kelly because they're going out of town. Kelly to Michigan and Kathryn to work crew for three weeks. Bye dearies, have fun! Catie had to go go home for a trumpet lesson so then Kel, Kath and I rented Mystic Pizza--which was ok. The ending you would expect from a chick flick. I wish I worked in a cute little pizza joint...  My brother John is being a meany (like my nice grown-up word?) and he's blaring the TV until I get off the computer so it looks like I gotta jet. You people better call me tonight! Toodles.

So I am sitting in Real Life, it is a college ministry put on by Calvary Chapel Corvallis.  Mark, the head pastor guy is leading worship.  I have had my run-ins with him before, I have never been able to put my finger on why but I am exceptionally critical of everything that he does.  I am usually a critical person, more so than some people, but something happens when I am around Mark.  I enter a different level of critical, it seems that what ever he says, I automatically start to look for ways that he is in contradiction somewhere in the bible.  Even if I have to twist a verse or two, it seems that I have some desire, no need, to be abrasive to him.  The more I think about this the more I realize how sad it is.  He could have something amazing to share with me and yet something, (pride? Arrogance?) is keeping me from even talking to this guy on the same level as a random guy walking down the street.  I guess that I do not like the idea of someone adopting the attitude that they are superior in ANY way, especially in matters of religion.              What set me off tonight was Mark singing along in true form, I was in a foul mood to begin with, so at the insistence that everyone stand up I was hit with this thought, “Why would I stand up? How does this make me more in harmony with God?” So after the first song I sat down and started to journal some of this out, which led me to recap this last weekend, I was feeling great, I was opening up some thoughts in my brain that needed to be dusted off and preserved in a leak proof container.  Needless to say my attention was not anywhere near praise or singing, than something happened that snapped me out of my little dream world.  Mark was singing than he said, “Why don’t you all get down on your knees and praise the Lord”.  I was floored; I have always had a problem with the whole raising your hands in church, at least when someone asks you to do it.  This seemed to be a whole new level, everyone just sat there still singing a little or looking around.  Mark repeats himself; “you can all get down on your knees now and praise the lord” than a few of his groupies did as they were bid and went down on their knees.  My journal looks something like: bla bla bla bal why the f*** is mark asking for kneeling down??!!! Bla bla bla bla.  OK so that is a word for word translation of that little encounter.  I was feeling so bad that I just got up and left to go get some ingredients for the wicked good baked beans.  Mmm they will be good.              Something that hit me as I was riding my bike back from Winco was that I was just journaling about my short comings and failures when the whole little encounter with the kneeling thing happened so I went from recounting my failures to being upset with this guy who I know nothing about but puts a great game face forward and hides his sin very well.  It was totally a scene out of the Simpson’s, where you look over at the Flander’s and they are all holy and than back to the Simpson family who are dark and rotten.  That is how I felt, looking at this guy who is oh so holy than back to my own failures and shortcomings.  I guess that I just do not know what to say about that.             So I was replaying some of my life’s worst moments in my mind my great failures.  Something that I thought was how far does God’s grace cover?  I know that I have messed up in my life, a lot, lots of times, different places, and yet still it does not eat away at me as it does some people, I remember it and try and avoid the pitfalls that took me to those places.  Still I can post an entry full of details about my past or spill my guts to just about anyone who would listen.  I have a friend who is constantly riddled with the guilt of some of the same sins that I have in my life, he is truly tormented by what he has done.  I do not know how to feel about this.  Should I feel guilt, should I feel shame, should I even remember? (not that I could forget even if I wanted to)  Or is grace understanding forgiveness?  Forgiveness is putting it away right, as if it never happened so we hold on to this in our minds, as humans we continue to torture ourselves with the incessant memory.  If the perfect God who remembers to wake you up every morning can forget something, you would think my leaky brain and I could do the same.  -“Men don’t follow title they follow courage” (Braveheart) M@	m
1. The first rule is to question everything that the President does –even in a time or war.    It is our duty in a democracy and it is unpatriotic not to do so –especially in a time of war.    If the ‘other side’ says that we are aiding and abetting the enemy –we scream ‘foul’ and claim that they are contesting our constitutional guarantee of dissent.            2. The second rule is ALWAYS distrust the motives of the President –it’s a personal check and balance that keeps us safer.               3. We      must always criticize the economy –regardless of what the numbers      show.    It is unpatriotic to assume      that ‘  America        can’t be better’.    It would dishonor      those killed on 9/11 not to expect more of our leaders.          4. We must always remember the economic horn of plenty that Clinton provided-don’t let anyone imply this was a tech bubble; and reject the idea of the Clinton/Gore recession in 2000-2001 because they can not be blamed that a tech bubble burst.          5. You      can cover all political bases by voting for a war, but then criticizing it      later.    This is an important rule as you will always have two sides to stand on regardless of the crowd that you are addressing.    The hawks will      respect you for voting for it, and the doves will love you for protesting      against it.          6. If your constituents are mad that you voted for the war just vote against the funding of the war. To avoid people saying that you are hurting the troops, claim that the bill was worded wrong and that you didn’t want to give the President a ‘blank check’.         When all else fails continue to evoke the evils of the President.          7. Attempt      to discredit everyone in the current Administration even if some were      appointed by your political allies.         When they are correct –take credit.         If they mess up –cut them and run and blame the Administration for      keeping him too long.          8. Use      any minor infraction to discredit the opposition.    Try not to belittle the soldiers,      because the American people won’t like that but the Administration is fair      game.    If you discover people putting underwear on someone else’s head or treating a prisoner in any way less than would be expected at the Waldorf Astoria, report ‘wide-spread torture’ and keep using the word ‘atrocity’.    While you are at it –bring impeachment charges against the President just incase he wins a second term-start proceeding immediately.    Downplay      any horror committed by the opposition as retaliation for the war in      general.          9. Do not let them use Nick Berg / Paul Johnson as a diversion to any news here at home –dwelling on these deaths may remind the people what we are fighting for and there is a possibility they may rally behind the President.          10. Constantly remind your constituents of all the awful things that America has done –never let them de-humanize the enemy or label them as ‘terrorists’ because they will relate it to 9/11 and may rally behind this corrupt administration.    Remind them that we have done terrible things to African Americans and the Japanese and that we are not superior to anyone-reiterate cultural tolerance (Maybe even quote one of the 'nice' verses from the Koran).            11. Don’t      let   America        forget that we too have bombed things and killed innocent civilians and      that the opposition in the  Middle East  are just young freedom fighters who strongly believe in what they are fighting for …didn’t we kill the British when we felt that they were invading our land.            This is what I have learned in the past two weeks in my conversations with liberals on these blogs.    It is wrong for me to have a flag or a yellow ribbon because that is implying that Republicans own Patriotism and that those who don’t want to fly the flag somehow love the country less than I do.    I should be more worried about protecting a person’s right to borrow 'Tthe Anarchist Cookbook' from the library, and having it be kept private, than the security of my homeland –because that is the premise my homeland was built on.    I should never insinuate that we should feel funny if 5 Muslim men -in there 20s- all get on my plane reading the Koran... because that would be racial profiling and lots of Muslims love the West and if we go down that road they may all end up in interment camps.    The other side can accuse the president of every atrocity known to man, but I can question nothing about John Kerry because he served in   Vietnam  …     Does everyone know that…John Kerry was on a swift boat in   Vietnam  ?	f
"I remember when I first brought it home. So small, it's cute little circuits, innocent little buttons and not to mention shinier then my old one. I just had to love it. Got it all set up and cozy in my office, then pulled my eyes out in frustration every other week trying to get the stupid thing to work. No, we're not talking about a toaster (that's another entry for another day}, we are talking about my computer.  Although my current computer's service was short (I only got it in December), it seems to be on it's death bed... literally.  All the fond memories we shared, playing TSO... and um... talking in Yahoo, making insane signatures for Stratics etc etc... it always gave me trouble. I don't think I will miss it! Perhaps I will stamp ""good riddance"" on its forehead and send if off to some boot camp to get it in shape (har har har).  Ok, so I'm just pissed at my computer, its being a jerk. Maybe I forgot our anniversary... or it's birthday? WHO THE HELL KNOWS! I could blame this all on the computer... but I must take some responsibility. I tried my best, I guess that wasn't enough so the computer has shunned me away, ""jdfkahsdakihdkjahd.dll required, please restore"" is just its way of saying, ""Let's start seeing other people."" Bitter sweet rejection... After I gave it such a nice home!  Ok, I'm done with weird ranting; My computer is broken, for how long I cannot say! I can't even get passed the start up screen! It's really awful! I thought I would post something here since I probably wont be logging into TSO or Yahoo, or anything for that matter as much, which can be expected when your computer can now be outrivaled by a key chain flash light for entertainment. Hey, at least I can make shadow puppets with that, the soft blue glow of an error screen just doesn't provide enough light to capture the depth of my characters! Maybe I will get a real life now... maybe just maybe... Oh, and someone tell the Nayrooduh he can have my computer now! (I bet he says, “Bah!"")  Anywhoo, I will still check in from time to time by hijacking others computers (like right now), but until I get my computer  working again, and at this rate it will probably be days, you will not be graced with my presence often. So please console each other and mourn me as much as you see fit!   Corn"	f

I have a date for nxt week, at least i think its a date. It involved a guy (who shall remain nameless) asking me 2 c a movie or hangout wit him. Would u count that as a date? Neway i have been thinking about it 2day. If it is a date then aftawards he mite wanna hook up wit me. Atm i dont wanna hook up wit ne1. Altho da last couple of months i had been thinking that i wanted a bf, but 2day i realised that i dont. Im partly afraid that da past will repeat itself, but i also know that i only like him as a friend. I know that i wont fall in love wit him, and the infatuation that i have felt the last couple of days towards him that has made me blind has dissappeared. Now im scared. I hate having ppl fall 4 me and have me not be able 2 return the feelings. But i know my heart does not lie wit him but wit sum1 else (who shall also remain nameless).  Maybe im just afraid, like i said afraid of my past repeating itself. The whole Josh scenario happening, not the almost stalking part and evrything. The part where i said yes when he asked me out not knowing at all y, then having him fall in love wit me and me do da stupid thing and say that i loved him when i didnt and then have my parents think he was fanatastic so then when i wanted 2 break up wit him they didnt want me 2. Thats only plays a minor role tho, the fact is i cannot give my heart 2 him no matter wat bcoz i dont feel that way about him. i told a friend last nite on the fone that if this guy she knows likes her she should go out wit him even tho she loves sum1 else. I cant believe i said that bcoz i myself could neva do that. And i refuse 2. Now i dont know wat 2 do, should i make up an excuse y i cant c amovie wit him or should i go and then if he makes a move say that i thought it was just friends hanging out 2gether, nothing more. Well luckily i have 2moro and monday 2 think about it, maybe even longer.  neways i betta go, enough bout guys.  One day ur prince will come, mine just took a wrong turn, got lost and is 2 stubborn to ask 4 directions.  Love hides behind evry corner...i must be walking in circles  Buh Bye  PS btw i am not in love wit the 2nd nameless guy mentioned, i just like him more than a friend, theres sumthing about him, but i dunno wat it is.	f
"hi guys... a few thoughts: be sure to read the next phase of our current project. the next step is NOT to simply add planting to your island. it is to create unique spaces untilizing materials and planting along with a ""theme"" to create garden display spaces. be sure to take your creativity to the limits... make your spaces as inviting and interesting as possible. though there is to be only one ""structure"" (meaning building) you can add other constructed elements such as pergolas, arbors, amphitheater type areas, walls, barriers, etc. keep thinking about materials and most importantly SPATIAL SEQUENCING.  also... there is a lecture tongiht in the weaver auditorium. jim urban will be lecturing about something extraordinarily relevant to the world of landscape architecture (though i do not recall what exactly...). you should go. i cannot."	f
"There is little doubt, in my mind at least, that motherhood is fattening.  And as far as I know, there is no low carb version.  I was never really fat until becoming a mother.  Sure, I had had an encounter or two (more like 23) with unfriendly scales before, but it took motherhood to get me my membership in the Obesity Club.  It all started when I got that plus sign on the pregnancy test.  I was so excited that I simply had to celebrate with my two best buds: Ben  Jerry.  I didn't toast with champagne, instead I ate two pints of Chunky Monkey with a Chubby Hubby chaser.  Afterall, I did need to increase my calcium intake.  Strong bones and teeth and all that.  I quit smoking cold turkey so I also quit running.  The way I saw it, if I was no longer slowly poisoning my cardiovascular system with tobacco, then there was no need for me to kill myself on a treadmill.  I was even steven.  Besides, pregnancy has it's own aches and pains.  Why add to it with all that needless exercise?  When the queasiness of morning sickness popped in on me, I treated it to a full on banquet.  I stuffed everything in my mouth.  Nothing was too heavy or greasy for this sufferer.  Most people when sick to their stomach refuse to eat or they eat lightly.  No, not me.  When sick, I must eat, and eat  good  food.  I once spent the night in the ER hooked up to IV fluids since I couldn't keep even water down.  When discharged, I went home and demanded my mom order me a pizza.    ""No,"" she said incredulously.  ""You can have some broth and saltines.""  I negociated my way up to a package of ramen noodles to which I added some ham and two slices of cheese when she wasn't looking.  I also grabbed several Pop Tarts, a box of Little Debbie brownies, and some Cheezits for dessert.  Hey, I was sick!  I needed to feel better and some shitty hot water bullion and crackers made of dried paste just wasn't going to cut it.  It didn't cut it when I was a kid with the stomach flu and it didn't cut it when I was (almost) a mom and miserable from the HCG poisoning my body suffered from for the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.  I basically ate nonstop right through the first trimester.  Oh, and forget diet pop.  No way was I going to expose my precious unborn child to potentially harmful chemicals.  Instead, I drank so much high fructose corn syrup that my pancreas went into shock I and developed Gestational Diabetes.  No surprise then, that precious babe was born so fat that she didn't need to gain any weight for 6 full weeks.  I gained 10lbs every month.  Month after month, for nine full months.  You do that math.  I was so big that when my friend Holly came to visit us, her husband Ron took one look at me and said, ""Well, I guess we don't have to go anywhere for whale watching.""    When I went home for my baby shower, my great, great, great aunt Doris (thin as a rail since she never had children) greeted everyone as they walked in the door with, ""Look out!  She's as big as a house!"" whispered as loud as a lion's roar.  She later embraced me in a fragile hug and said, ""Don't worry, honey.  That weight'll come right off.  I've seen 'em all blow up like you.  Well, maybe not that big.  But they lost the weight.  You will, too.""  And that's where they get you.  Everyone tells you that the weight will just ""melt right off"" after the baby is born.  Especially if you are breastfeeding.  Weightloss is touted as one of the magic benefits to breastfeeding by that lying Le Leche League.  Yeah, right.  And my tits are the size of mosquito bites and produce White Russians after 9pm.  The truth is that a nursing mother's body holds on to fat ""like a bulldog to a bone,"" as my friend Michelle puts it.  You could eat nothing but lettuce and egg whites, exercise like an Olympic athlete in training, and pump yourself up on caffeine.  The only results you'll see is stomach upset, shin splints, and a cranky baby that only sleeps 10 minutes at a time due to the caffe latte coming from your udders.   It's some kind of evolved protection mechanism, to safeguard against famine.  Fat is like money in the bank and I got lots of twinkie investments stored up on my ass just in case the locusts descend upon Safeway.  My offspring and I could live off the interest of Doritos and Cherry Garcia for six complete months.  I guess I can take pride that in a ""survival of the fittest"" world, I would beat out Deborah Messing or Gwyneth Paltrow.  They and their offspring would shrivel and turn to dust since they didn't bank their food.  Silly ninnies.  There are those who encourage mothers to embrace and celebrate their new, softer, rounder bodies.  I will admit that if I were my child I would love that saggy piece of flesh that once was my abdomen.  It's so soft it's almost fluffy and makes the perfect pillow for watching Dora the Explorer.  I, however, am less than pleased.  I am not a pillow, I am a person.  I may be a mother, but I am also a woman who wants to be attractive.  I am human and I seek approval from society.  I need to be a normal weight.  I need to be a normal size again.  The time has come to buckle down.  All this extra baggage around my middle is only going to come off one way and it will be a hard road to success.

We overweight mothers need to band together and work toward one goal:  Government Funded Plastic Surgery!!!  Ha.  You thought I was going to say ""lose weight.""  Like I said, that ain't happening.  Been there.  Done that.  Got the stretchmarks.  That weight isn't going to just melt off.  As long as I'm still nursing, the only thing that is melting around here is my Ben  Jerry's Half Baked.

"the movie  i watched ""my best friends wedding' all over again a couple of nights ago when i had nothing to do. it was actually mom who had nothing to do.. rather, she needed some unwinding and thus we took the fateful decision of watching that movie together. now, before you proceed, you must remember that my mother loves comedies. the happy simple movies without any undertones of, or jokes on, sex, feel good movies, the more the laughs, the better it is. but of course, like us all, she is also a sucker for senti old hindi drama movies. the emotional ones that sing vande mataram at the drop of a hat, and then go and fall in love with pakistani girls.. well i like those movies too, but this isn't about that. we watched my best friends' wedding, and it was probably my millionth time. glued to the screen, i wished fervently that it would end differently. not till the end, i wished till somewhere midway - as long as there was a chance for lady luck to change the course of events... after a certain point, you know what is going to happen. the end is then a foregone conclusion. but for a long time i wished, oh i wished! sigh.  there is something heart rending about a blood-friend.. turning to someone else for life. in some scenarios it would be alright, but where there is attachment from one end... that is unfair. un fair    the book  after a long while of dawdling in modern day fiction, john grishams, salman rushdies.. i finally returned to good old thomas hardy. tess d'urberville.   in the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things, the call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with the hour of loving. Nature does not often say ""See!"" to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply ""Here!"" to a body's cry of ""Where?"" till the hide and seek has become an irksome, outworn game.   ill timed things have thus been explain by the master of tragedy. it might be strange, but in this era of harry potters, i still find the poignance of thomas hardy's books unbearable beautiful. things that ring true, touch the heart - he understands inexpressed sentiments and portrays them with extreme delicacy. an art.     flutterby  international fashion  urlLink trends  forecast butterflies for spring 2004. there couldn't have been a more beautiful creature to portray in womens' fashion - ever."	f

i am so excited about matt's progress.  it's so great to see him succeed.  today our psych (Carol) was here to observe and help us.  she was very encouraging in every way.  matt and i did a number of opening and closing circles.  he held the bubble wand up to my mouth--great interaction!  she said that matthew has so many great skills.  we also discussed that motor planning is an issue and also holding back language.  he seemed to respond well to minimal speech from me and soft talking.  we're going to start a brushing program followed by joint compressions.  at dinner tonight i worked with him on using a fork, he is doing so well!  i cut up watermelon and he was able to stab it and bring it right to his mouth.	f

Squash!  Take a pyrex baking dish or sturdy cookie sheet and spray it evenly for five seconds with Pam butter cooking spray.  Preheat oven to 400F.  Cut one acorn squash and one butternut squash lengthwise.  Find a knife with a bit of a serrated edge, or else you will find yourself with a handy new weapon called Knife-cum-squash as the sharp single blade seals itself inside the hard rind.  Once you've more or less split those fuckers in half, take a spoon and scoop out the near pumpkin-like seeds and dump them into the trash.  Lay each half fleshy side down in the baking dish/sheet.  Slide dish/tray into oven.  Set timer for 40 minutes, or go watch an episode of the X-Files you have on tape, fast-forwarding through the commercials, natch.  At 40 minutes, turn the halves over so their fleshy underbellies show to the sky.  Go another ten minutes at full blast.  Bring the dish/sheet out, and let cool for one or two minutes.  Pinning down the halves carefully with a fork, scoop out the mushy (cooked sweet potato consistency) insides onto your plate.  Salt, pepper, cinnamon, brown sugar, whatever you think might go well with this somewhat sweet squash.  Me, I didn't have brown sugar, and I like savory, so after the cinnamon, I added a really tiny pinch of ground cumin.  Whatever floats your boat.  Add a bit of some butter product (or sour cream, if you want the baked potato effect), and dig in.  It's quite filling.  Very healthy.  I really shouldn't have posted something so healthy to this blog.  Sorry about that.  It won't happen again.  Add more sour cream to the damn squash if you're a true cooking loser.  More butter, more syrup.	f

"I shared that I started the First Place weight loss program this past week.  I also shared how I was feeling so stressed over things with Megan and how I really hadn't done so well with the diet (I eat for comfort).  I don't remember if I actually mentioned that I was praying for something that would make me get serious and stick to the plan, but I was.    God answered me.  I am being very, very good about eating only what I should.  I just wish He hadn't chosen to scare the bejeebers out of me to get through to me.  But He did.    Somewhere along the way I jokingly said I was sure my blood pressure was up.  Yet at the same time, I hadn't felt good since Thursday.  Not really sick, but just not right.  Last night when I was at Wal-mart I walked past one of those blood pressure machines and thought ""why not?""  It hurt.  I probably should have stopped it like the directions said, but I wanted to see what the results were.  166/85 is not a good thing.  I am scared straight.  Tomorrow I call the doctor.  IN OTHER NEWS....  I didn't go watch Matt play on Friday.  Hardly anyone did.  Matt said there was only one teen other than the 4 who'd been asked to provide music there.  Ouch!  At least Matt had a good time hanging out with his friends and seeing their parents.  I don't know what the turnout means for the plans to restart the youth group.  I hope whatever they do, they make sure they're in God's will and not just jumping in because they think they need a youth group.  Before I left I was struggling with the relevancy of the group because all of the youth except my own kids were attending youth groups at other churches.  Their needs were already being met, so why reinvent the wheel?  I was trying to figure out a new way to minister.  Church was good today.  The senior pastor is on a mission trip to Indonesia (that's not why it was good) and the youth pastor filled in.  He spoke on Romans chapter 8 and about how a lot of Christians these days just don't get it and are very complacent because heaven and eternity seem so far away.  How it's like we know we're saved so why work on it in this lifetime....there's plenty of time.  Matt, Megan and I are meeting with the youth pastor tomorrow."	f

I'm in shock!  It's been sunny here in middle GA but what's even more shocking, has been the lack of humidity lately.  I can't believe it's been comfortable during the day and at night. Normally, it's hellish.  You can't breathe when you walk outside.  This is a very unlikely turn of events in GA weather.  I suspect it won't last for long....so I will enjoy it now!  Well..I'm still unemployed...haven't heard anything from the latest round of interviews.  I think I might just move back to Augusta and actively pursue putting the finishing touches on my discernment process for Holy Orders.  As I reflect and update my spiritual autobiography, I STILL have a strong desire to be in ministry fulltime.  The idea of some kind of chaplaincy is top in my line of thinking at this point.  I've thought for many years of doing military chaplaincy or some other form of chaplaincy.  So...I will put things in motion this week as I finish up my spritual autobio and send it to my supporting priest at my home parish.  and then we can begin really getting into this whole discernment thing.  I ask you to pray for me as I try and figure things out.  Thanks!  Blessings and peace.	m
"In July I met a wonderful soldier who is currently recovering from wounds he sustained in   Afghanistan   at   Walter   Reed    Medical   Center   in   Washington ,  DC  .    I have been in such awe at how positive he is and how committed to the cause he seems.    The picture above is of him and other recovering soldiers who were injured in both   Iraq   and   Afghanistan   (with Sean Hannity  Col. Ollie North).    I wanted to share with you a letter that he wrote me recently –I wanted you all to see his spirit and dedication first hand.    We have CB ( urlLink http://cbftw.blogspot.com/  ) to share ‘in theater’ news, but we don’t often get to hear from the boys that have come home seriously wounded.                 A*****,     We are all doing great.  There are new soldiers coming in almost every day.  It’s just a matter of how many now.  I am probably going to start working here at the hospital while I am recovering.  I am so tired of sitting around doing nothing.  Some of the soldiers are perfectly fine with it.  I guess the boredom hasn't hit them like it has hit me.       They were talking about sending me back to   Nashville   to finish my therapy.  I complained about it and won the battle for now.  It just didn't make any sense whatsoever to send me home and then re-deploy me in a couple more months.  I mean...Geez.  As for the soldiers wanting out, send them home so they can get home health care.  We have quite a few retirees sitting here waiting to be released but have got to get an ""ok"" from medical.  It's such a long process.  It could be a lot easier if the people of the govt. didn't make it so hard.     I haven't seen A***** ( his daughter ) since right before we met.  I have talked with her.  Of course, she is ready for both of us to move back to TN and get ours lives back on course.  I look forward to those days too.  We have another job at hand and this is something I have to do first.  She hates it, but understands it.  She won't be too happy when I go back to the theatre ( they tried to talk him out of it, but he insisted on being re-deployed ).  I do so miss her.  I struggle with the complexities of life that I have put her in by being a soldier.  This makes me wish I would have gotten out so many times before.  In turn, I am an American, a father, a son, a brother, a friend, and I am free.  I am going to stand my ground and support the cause so those that follow me or are like me can live free, without feeling threatened by terrorists in the   USA  .    The USO, the US Govt., and many volunteers and other organizations set up these events ( Explaining all the pictures he sent me with celebrities like Reba and R. Lee Ermy ).  The concerts are usually mutual between the artist and the USO.  They want the soldiers there so they can show their support and the soldiers want to go.  The biggest kicker is that it is almost always completely free to the soldier.  The trips are always free, but if someone wants a memento, that is usually out of pocket.  This isn't saying that we are never given anything.  OMG, people are always giving and giving.   It truly makes a person proud to be a soldier.       The biggest drawback is that after all this daily attention is gone and they have completed their recovery and go home...the high amounts of praise and attention will diminish.  I only hope that our soldiers are strong enough to maintain those high spirits at home and continually work to regain being a positive member of society.  I pray that they become better people after their accidents than they were before.       There is no other country in the world greater than ours.  I am and forever will be proud to call myself an American.       Strength and Honor,     S***          If anybody wants to comment to him I will make sure that he reads this! Thanks S***!"	f

"Nathan, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I completely and totally over-reacted.  And the rest of you thought this post would be all hostile.  Best Joan of Arcadia Ever! Yay! If you aren't watching now, you should be!  Here's the part of the post that was nice...  2.18 - 17 People  The episode that set up sweeps week, as well as the future of the show. Bartlet's MS is revealed to Toby, who freaks out and tears both Leo and Bartlet new cornchutes. (I actually would have enjoyed a scene where he goes off on the first lady and she slaps him. But this is a serious episode...) Meanwhile Sam and Josh try to write jokes for a speech for the Correspondent's Dinner. Sam invites Ainsley up to write jokes and the end up debating the Equal Rights Amendment. Powerful episode, masterfully captured by Alex Graves, who is probably the most talented director on the show since Schlamme left. Great acting from Marten Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Rob Lowe. However Richard Schiff turns in a powerhouse performance and steals the show and runs.  Also I don't understand dell. What is a dell exactly? And what does Dell Computers's catch phrase ""Easy as Dell"" mean. Cause it's stupid and I don't get it!"	m

"from  urlLink The Curt Jester : Fuzhou (AsiaNew/Ucan) - A Marian shrine in Fujian province has attracted a large number of Protestants as well as Catholics this May.   Sister Zheng Wenying of Fuzhou estimates that at least 1,000 Protestants from Fujian and neighboring provinces had visited Rosary Hill Village by the middle of the month that Catholics traditionally devote to Mary. Most came in groups ranging from dozens to a hundred, led by Protestant pastors.  Sister Zheng told that nuns of the diocese explained Catholic teachings about the Blessed Mother to some visiting Protestant groups. Some members of these groups agreed that revering both Jesus and his mother would make their Christian faith more complete, she said, adding that ""some even knelt and prayed in the church.""   WOW."	m

If all goes as planned I should be able to visit Myanmar next week. I'm currently like a 2 minute walk from the embassy and ready to get a visa. I've been waiting out there lunch hour and I'll finish up my hour which only costs 20 baht (50 cents). This is a great price and I have all kinds of cool games to play too. It's amazing what happens when you get out of the touristy areas. Gabe by the time I'm done with this trip you'll have such a good idea of the pricing startegy in this part of the world you'll never get ripped off. I managed to get a little sleep but not much. I'm not too tired and I'll just rough it out for the rest of the day. I think I'll take the river taxi back, book my ticket and then hit a movie.  I always seem to hit Bangkok at awkward times. I wish I could just go and get my visa done but of course it takes two working days and Saturday and Sunday aren't working days so that'll set me back two days. This happened last time when I was getting visas, what a pain. But I'll make the best of it. There are several day tours I can take and I might even leave town for a few days and come back when my visa is ready.  I had Micky D's for lunch and it was awesome. Unfortunatly it really doesn't fill you up all that much when you're killer hungry. I'll have to grab some food after the visa run.  I spent the monring shopping around for the best price on visas and tickets. The visa is simple enough to do by myself (or so it seems), it's a ton cheaper and the tickets I can get for about $150 round trip. This is better than I thought. I hope to spend at least 2 weeks or so there. Judging from the book there are about 5 cities I'd like to visit. This would cap off an awesome trip in a great way.  I wonder what's playing at the theater? It's so good to have a day to just chill out and relax a bit. Even though I guess I've really been doing stuff most of the time it hasn't been all touristy and whatnot.  Ok time to see if they'll give me a visa.	m
"Good morning, Lord.  Thank you for another day.  Another opportunity to move forward with you. May I use this day for unprecedented joy in the hope of your glory.

I choose to obey your commands and when I do not, I choose to come to you for forgiveness.  I choose not to fear the darkness and gloom, nor to entertain the enemy's lies.  I choose to fight.  I choose to be dependent upon your body, upon those you have placed around me.  I choose to meet the needs of others and to be willing to have my own needs met.  I choose to be true to who you have made me to be and not to desire someone else's life.  I choose to forgive others.  I choose to forgive myself.  I choose to conquer.  I choose to live.

"Now here is my secret, very simply secret: you can only see things clearly with your heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye  .     aaah, the Little Prince.  I was with my baby at our neighborhoods ""toddler time"", when all the little ones play together. We were right outside the gym. I thought how sad it was that instead of running outside and playing like little children, they were miserable and running on the indoor tracks.  I have had alot of little epiphanies like that since I had my son. I know it sounds trite, but I have learned more from this new little soul than I have in the 33 years before I had him. I had no idea what love was really all about, what patience was about. How little moments make all the difference in the world.  I see everything differently now. I am so much more calm than I was. Ok, I still worry about stupid stuff, but not like I used to. I dont care if I am the skinniest, or the coolest, or even if my pants dont have cookie sludge on them. Why? Because he loves me because I am his Mommy, not because of the external. I mostly love my body now, because how could I hate something that brought that wonderful being into the world?

"the way you want to be treated.  We've all heard it, and most of us try to abide by it.  For my whole life, I have been told to live by and uphold that philosophy in my life.  But where has it gotten me?  Let's take a look.  Early years: My cousin Sean would always hit me with  something, but mom told me never to do that, so I didn't.  3-5 grade: Kids picked on me and called me fat, I was always the tallest but I was never mean to anybody.  6th grade: First part was homeschooled, then I moved here to NC and went to public school.  Didn't talk to most people, didn't want to become the butt of all the jokes at such a huge school.  7th grade: Went to a Catholic school, where people made fun of me there.  Why?  Mostly because I had a gamecube and I thought Yugioh was a cool show, but they were all misled by the bad American job of it.  Nobody would talk to me unless it was to make fun or laugh at me.  I was called some pretty mean things, but I never returned any of those insults.  In between: I broke my collar bone.  Then I was over at my grandma's house, when my cousin (different one) approached me.  We never talked much, then he started to mess around, then he pushed me hard on my broken collar bone, into a wall which my broken bone smashed into.  Then he went to school and told everyone that, he said ""I wanted to toughen him up.""  Later, when I went there for 9th, someone came up to me and mentioned it.  I laughed at it and said ""oh yeah, I remember that.""  8th grade: Skipped  9th: I went to another Catholic school, a much smaller one, one that my cousin when to, the one that broke my collar bone.  Met a couple of cool people, I was friends with most everybody there, and the several people I wasn't really ""friends"" with, weren't really mean, they just weren't really my type, and I wasn't theirs, but we still respected each other.  Now: Well, today, I was at my uncle's for dinner, when I sat down, and I saw my cousin (one who hurt my broken collar bone) carrying a tray of chicken.  Now, this cousin is a muscular guy, that chicken was pretty light, he's held much heavier things for much longer than this tray of chicken, but he needed to bring it inside.  He was calling someone to open the door, so I went over to open it for him, trying to be nice, but not before weighing my two options.  If I didn't open the door, he'd say ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?  Didn't you see I couldn't open the damn door?""  So I decided to be nice to someone who had never been nice to me, and open the door.  Then he said, ""get the hell out of my way."" I then said, ""you're welcome"".  I mean, come on, the guy was a jerk, but the least he could say was thank you, even my grandpa says ""thank you"", however sarcastic and mean it might sound.  My cousin just says ""shut the hell up"" and gave me nasty looks all night.  Now, someone commented on this, and said, ""you were being a smart ass, saying 'your welcome', he just retorted.""  Well, see above comment about at least having some dignity and saying thank you.  This person also said that this cousin is older than myself, and even this friend of mine pushed around some of his younger family.  Well I certainly do not, due to the fact I was not raised like that.  So, my mother and father have said it, ""be nice to others"" and this friend has said it.  I told my friend all of this, and he said that I ""missed the point"" as usual.  Well what has it gotten me?  Okay, only thing good, um, 9th grade year.  Well hold on a sec, I try to maintain my easygoing air about me, try to stay fun, around my family and friends.  My family always calls me ""dork"" or ""idiot"", and I just brush it off (my friend says I should do this more), and online, we joke around too.  Then somebody says ""dork"" or ""idiot"" or something like that.  Well, my happy level tends to drop, due to my past history... the more they say it... the more sad, and eventually angry I become.  It actually takes a while for this to happen, but come on, cut a guy some slack.  This has happened all my life, I try to tell people that, but they just tell me ""don't drag things out, that's your problem"".  By the end of 7th grade, I was pretty much fed up with ""letthing things go"", and I decided to take a more defensive stance.  When people crossed a line, I told them.  Then they would say things like ""lighten up"" and ""don't take things to the 10th degree"", and this happens until today.    I try to be nice, and respect people, then they turn around and are pretty rude to me, all for their various justifiable reasons, but sometimes they are just too... well you get the idea... I don't like it.  I just thought some of you guys/girls would like to see a quick rundown of my life.  Not too much happy?  Well, not too much WAS happy when it came to school... some friends, but not many, mostly people who insulted me, and only when I was hanging around by myself, which was/still is actually a lot compared to some."	m
last night the moon was shining through my window, it wasn't quite a full moon, but it was close. it looked like a painting, round and bright and white, with a halo of hazy light surrounding it, and wisps of grey clouds half obscuring it. it threw a shaft of cool light into my room, and across my bed, the shaft of light moved slowly as the moon slowly rode across the sky, but i fell asleep before it reached my head.  with full moons and mozart and a room with a view, i have been feeling romantic. i had a dream that prolonged this mood, the feelings concerned with the dream have invaded the whole day and my mind keeps wandering back to it. nothing much happened in the dream, it was a boy, who took all the rings off my fingers and laid his head in my lap. i put my hand on his head. it was one of the best dreams i've had for a long time, i woke up feeling peaceful, i could almost still feel the weight and warmth of his body as he lay on the sofa, resting against me. i didn't want to move for a while, after i awoke, for fear of disturbing the feeling, but i needn't have worried because it has remained all through the day.	f
Since we're on the house, I think it's time for me to address this phobia that I've developed.  It's packing.   In November, I packed up a ton of crap (since we were supposed to be moving in around last Christmas).  All my books, save for the three that I was reading, all the living room knicknacks, a lot of nonessential kitchen gear, like extra pots, pans, serving dishes, etc, winter clothes, summer clothes, clothes that have gotten to be too big for us, a bunch of Alden's toys...  Just, a ton of random crap, right?  Thinking we were only going to be without these things for a month, tops.  It's almost August.  8 months have gone by, that I've been without that stuff.  No biggie, nonessential, right?  Well, it's that time again, I'm afraid.  I know, deep in my heart that I should start packing again, so we can just hustle over there.  We could be living there in three weeks.  It could also take another 5 months.  We're relying on unreliable people, we have a lot of inspections to go through still, and shoot, I might wind up strangling the plumber, and we all know what a pain in the ass it is, to find a new guy, mid job.  I know I should pack, and be optimistic.  I'm not going to, though.  Not till I have the Code of Occupancy in my hand (or at least processing).  Optimism has gotten me nowhere.	f

ANALYSIS OF THE BIG, AND NOT SO BIG, TEN    Well, we now have 10 Democrats vying for the nomination.  Let’s see if I can name them all.         Dean – Front runner.  Something evil about his eyes.  Don’t trust him.  Wants to take money away from the poor.  He wants to repeal all the tax cuts  Kerry – Vietnam War vet.  Tries to portray himself as the big war hero. Edwards – Good ‘Ol boy, but ashamed of it. Clark – Eisenhower wannabe.  But not.  Michael Moore's favorite.  Moore's endorsment alone would be enough to make me drop out. Lieberman – The only one that makes any sense. Sharpton- No chance in hell. Kucinich – Who? Braun – Again, who? Gephardt – No chance. Graham – Again, no chance in hell.     Damn, that’s better than most of the country.  Most of the country can’t even name one of them.  The thing about these candidates is, not what they have to say, because so far they haven’t said anything about how they would do something, it’s all about who can bash Bush the best.  That’s who’s going to get the nomination.  All you have to say is “Bush is bad” the best way and *BOOM* you have the nomination.  The Democrats are still upset that they lost in 2000 and 2002, so it’s whoever can stir up those feelings the best that they will choose.       God Bless America	m

urlLink GameSpotting: Final Fight  I did this with gamecube and thankfully no problems but I here lots of bad things about ps2 and xbox being bought early hardware and price were the issues.

ESPN.com ran a  urlLink story  today about John Elway inviting his former coach Dan Reeves to his Hall of Fame induction ceremony in August.  Growing up a die hard Broncos fan this was great news to me.  The Elway-Reeves feud was well documented, and I hated to see how bad it had gotten between the two of them.    A lot has been made of the numbers Elway could have put up if it wasn't for Reeves coaching style.  I agree that Reeves coaching style held Elway back, but Reeves came from the Tom Landry school of coaching where you grind it out and throw very little.  Thinking back it's hard to believe neither of the above coaches changed their strategy much considering they had Elway and Staubach leading their teams.    Elway finally got his rings, and unfortunately Reeves never did.  I think Reeves was a hell of a coach who just couldn't win the big one.  Then again look at the teams he took to the Super Bowl.  Of the four teams he took to the big game, none of them really had any business being there, and it showed by the final score.  Dave and I had the opportunity to meet Coach Reeves in the summer of 2000.  We were guests at the Falcons training camp and that was something I will not forget soon.  Dave and I show up, and here comes Coach Reeves out of his office with a list of dumb blonde jokes he starts telling Dave and I.  Coach Reeves and his secretary Brenda took great care of us the whole trip.  Later I was able to attend two Falcons games and even get down on the sidelines before one game.  Coach Reeves might not be in any top ten lists for greatest coach ever but to me he is number one.  He played and coached with class, and he treated a goofy kid like me better than I could have ever dreamed of.  Not many coaches have 200 victories, so this should get Reeves into the Hall sometime in the near future.  And when this happens, I might have to make the trip to Canton to see my favorite coach growing up get the credit he deserves.	m
Hubby dropped me off at mom's early today.  I was reading 'Bloody Bones' by Laurell K. Hamilton (Anita Blake Series) until I heard my mom and sis waking up.  We ate cereal and watched soaps for a bit and then I started cleaning the house.  The usual stuff: dishes, vacuuming, washing toilets, sinks, clothes, no mopping today... mom didn't have pine sol and I didn't want to use soapy water. I was afraid that I wouldn't rinse it out completely fromt he floors, especially the bathrooms, and that she may slip.  Sis took care of the lunch.  She made rice, beef with veggies, and then more veggies. yum yum.  More dishes.  Well, we took mom shopping after that. She now has pine sol... well, Fabuloso, a Mexican brand for floor cleaner. It smells great and is what I use at my own house. ^_^  I use it for everything, floors, commodes, sinks, tubs, the kitty's litter box, man it's great, economic, and the bottle lasts for month and months.  I gotta love Mexican products.  Got back to her house, watched a movie, Hubby and Dad got back home and then Hubby and I left.  He took me to eat at a Mexican restaurant and then I went to the beauty salon to get a haircut.  hehehe... can you say 80s punk rocker?  It's SPIKEY!!!	f
"MORE SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE  Billy Ray Cyrus and his ""achy breaky heart"" are coming back to record stores near you.  Back October 28th with the release of  urlLink ""The Other Side"" , Cyrus has traded in the mullet for a revelation from God that he should record an ""inspirational"" album testifying to his ""deep Christian faith"".  I'm pretty sure the Anti-Christ lives on Pennsylvania Avenue.  I'm just waiting for my Dasani to turn to blood.   FURTHER SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE  The Catholic Church now asserts that HIV-infected individuals should not use  urlLink condoms  as they do not protect against the disease or its transmission.  Who knew there was a branch of the Centers For Disease Control in Vatican City?  Is it a wonder I don't go to church any longer.   HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE  Late Tuesday, the United States  urlLink vetoed  an Arab backed U.N. resolution denouncing Israel's building of a ""security fence"" on Palestinian territories in the disputed West Bank.  The U.S. said the failure to denounce acts of terrorism and the groups responsible made the resolution ""unbalanced"".  There were four countries (Great Britain, Cameroon, Germany and Bulgaria) who abstained from voting.  With the U.S. continuing to shield Israel from any fault in the ongoing unrest in the Middle East--instead of trying to constructively work with the parties involved.  While Palestinians shoulder their share of the blame, Israel's failure to recognize the established ""Green Line"" partitions serves to further aggrevate the situation.    KIDMAN BROKE NO LAW  The lovely Nicole Kidman reigned  urlLink victorious  in her legal action against the British tabloid,  The Sun .  The paper had claimed that Kidman had an affair with the lovely Jude Law on the set of their upcoming Winter flick ""Cold Mountain"".  Further, the paper claimed said affair led to the break-up of Law's marriage to Sadie Frost.  Ms. Kidman gained a formal apology and an undisclosed (but rumored five-figure) settlement.  Ms. Kidman is no homewrecker.  Truth be told, I had an affair with Mr. Law.  I did.  Really.  Ms. Frost no longer speaks to me.   THE GOOD GIRL  Last night I watched Miguel Arteta's  urlLink ""The Good Girl""  on DVD.  While the films pacing and editing are a bit choppy, one can't help but be won over by the winning performances of Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tim Blake Nelson and John C. Reilly.  Disarmingly funny and ultimately tinged with a dollop of fatalism, the DVD features a bevy of goodies.  Along with commentary from Arteta and Aniston, the film's writer Mike White adds to the insights.  There are nine deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  Aniston reveals that she has acting chops beyond ""Friends"".  How much do I love ""Retail Rodeo"" and the brilliant Zooey Deschanel as the quirky Cheryl?  Two Thumbs way up."	m

"urlLink Back to the Agora: Workable Solutions for Small Urban School Facilities. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Barbara Kent Lawrence.  From the ERIC Digest:  Two preconceptions make providing facilities for small schools a challenge: that they will be more expensive per student than facilities for large schools, and that teaching and learning must occur in isolation from the community. Yet Socrates taught in the ""agora,"" an open market in ancient Athens, which, like the Roman ""forum,"" functioned as a marketplace for ideas and commerce. For students and teachers it offered an ideal place in which to learn and teach. This Digest suggests adapting such a model to meet modern needs, and shows that there are successful small schools that have already done so while reducing costs.   Several successful and innovative small urban schools (discussed below) have created places that are the modern equivalent of the agora, places where students and adults can interact with the community, share resources, and learn from each other. Such school designs can be ""courageously evolutionary--not just astoundingly revolutionary"" (Bergsagel, 2002, p. 1).    In a foresighted report, researchers DeArmond, Taggart, and Hill (2002, p. 5) identified five trends of education that should guide decisions about facilities: ""pressure on schools to perform for all students, . . . demands for the personalization of learning, new technologies, periodic shortages of teachers, and shifts in student population and residency patterns."" These pressures may require that school facilities be reconfigured in creative and innovative ways. DeArmond et al. suggest that ""facilities should focus on students' learning and achievement . . . be flexible . . . be responsive . . . trade-offs and choices should be transparent . . . provisions should be driven by data, and facilities should be economically efficient"" (DeArmond et al., p. 13).    How can the ideas of the ancient Greeks and modern researchers in education apply to school facilities?"	m

"By SHAFIKA MATTAR, Associated Press Writer  AMMAN, Jordan - The kidnappers of four Jordanians in Iraq (news - web sites) have promised to release them Saturday because their relatives and fellow staged an anti-American demonstration as demanded of them, the brother of a hostage said late Friday.  The kidnapping became known Tuesday when Dubai Television broadcast a video tape showing four men holding their identification cards. A man off-camera said ""all Muslim and Arab nations, especially those neighboring Iraq"" should not cooperate with the Americans.  Mohammed Abu Jaafar, whose brother Ahmad is being held, told The Associated Press said he received a call from one of the purported kidnappers who said they were pleased by the television pictures of the protest in Irbid in northern Jordan.  ""We decided to release them on Saturday morning,"" Abu Jaafar quoted the kidnapper as saying. The kidnapper said the hostages would be handed over at a Jordanian field hospital in Iraq or ""we will escort them to the border,"" he said.  Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Al Ayed said the government has instructed its embassy in Baghdad to investigate the kidnapping by a group calling itself ""Mujahedeen of Iraq, the Group of Death."" Insurgents have taken more than 70 foreigners hostage in Iraq in recent months in an effort to force their countries to withdraw troops and to hamper reconstruction work.  -- I'll believe it when they are free.

"GREEK ORTHODOX GOOD FRIDAY SERVICE   Okay, so Jeff asks me if I'd like to go to a Good Friday service at a Greek Orthodox church.  It seems he has been chomping at the bit to visit this church for a while.  As luck would have it, our friend Ryan attends a Greek Orthodox church and invited us to the Good Friday service.  So we went.  Ryan met us there.  We lit a white taper candle and stuck it in a sandbox near the door of the sanctuary.  I'm not sure why.  I simply followed the herd.  Please note that I am simply reporting what I experienced.  Ryan was sitting on the other side of Jeff so I didn't always hear the explanation of everything.  The church itself was one of the most beautiful churches that I have ever been in.  There were murals of different scenes of Jesus' life on all the walls.  Everyone had that heavy-eyelid look that was popular in Byzantinian art.  [Yes, I received an ""A"" in Art History 101.]  Jesus looked like Max Von Sydow.  Max played Ming the Merciles in  urlLink Flash Gordon .  Every time I looked up at the murals during the service, I would look at Jesus and hear ""Flash!  Ah-ahhhh.  Savior of the universe!""  It was very distracting.  I've noticed that there are many images of Jesus and the disciples looking very happy.  They always look so solemn.  It doesn't seem like very good marketing for a missionary selling the  Good News .  Of course, I suppose Jesus knew what was coming and I could understand seeming a bit non-plussed by that.  It makes you wonder exactly when Jesus knew in his life what his final moments on earth would be like. Did he know from the time he was born or just before he returned to Jerusalem?  There were six doors that separated the front area from an altar.  A different Biblical figure was on each door.  It sort of gave the impression that if you put 75cents into the coin slot, the door would open and you would receive a saint.    In actuality, only the far door on either end was truly functional.  Above these doors were images of the faces of Saints.  It reminded me of an add for a movie where is shows all the movie stars making cameos in a light comedy.  It was just another reminder what a strange little world I live in.  I view everything through pop culture glasses.  My favorite image was of the Madonna with child.  Her arms were at either side as if she was saying, ""Ta-duh!""  The baby Jesus stood on her lap looking more like a very small adult who was washed in very hot water and shrunk.  His hand was in the air and his fingers seemed to be forming the peace sign, which of course made me hear Richard Nixon saying, ""I've never been a quitter.""  It was a very ornamental church.  There were lots of icons as would be expected.  The service was conducted in Greek with some sections in English.  The liturgy was chanted in a very melodic fashion so it was very soothing to listen to.  We sat at times and then stood.  At one point, Ryan pulled out the kneeling tray without warning and almost amputated my foot, but I'm okay.  The hardest part for me was the incense smoker.  My nose is so hyper-sensitive to smoke now that there so few places that smokers can light up, that even the briefest hint of incense can make my sinus cavity quake with fear.  I'll be damned if the clergy didn't come by and swing that incense thingybobber in my face and just missing my nose by a few inches.  After two and a half hours, the congregation lined up to pay their respects to a mat that had the image of Jesus' body that was laid in a mock tomb.  They would pay their respects and kiss it and kiss a Bible too.  Some of the younger children crawled under this structure after they kissed the Jesus mat and Bible.  I presume it was for some blessing or for a good year or something along those lines.    Ryan apologized for the service going so long.  It seems the Bishop always drags the service out and he did not typically come to the 3:00pm service, but he did this time.    All in all, I found it to be a very beautiful service.  I enjoyed watching the faces of the congregants and seeing them emotionally respond to the service.  I've never felt emotionally connected to the church.  Emotions are things that should not be trusted at face value.  It's more important to understand things on an intellectual level.  My relationship with God is personal and their is emotion there, but it something expressed in private and not for all to see.  For a long time, I thought religion was something that everyone else got that I just didn't get.  It was like a joke where everyone else understood, but I didn't.  I didn't see the point of laughing along with everybody else if I didn't think it was funny.  Much of this is due to the fact that I grew up in the Church of Christ, which is a literalist church.  There are no musical instruments in the church service because of a scripture that says make music with your hearts.  I asked Ryan, who doesn't necessarily feel drawn to organized religion, why he comes to this church.  He said it was because it was what felt right or comfortable to him.  It was what he grew up with.  He liked the pagentry and the icons and the incense.  I thought that was interesting and it reflected back how my interpretation of the service was based upon my own religious upbringing and pop culture experiences.  Furthermore, it made me wonder what is more important: the message of Christianity or the style in which it is presented?"	m
"urlLink The Three Bulldogs:   :   Guiliani, Sharon and Safire     William ""Bulldog"" Safire writes about the new 'great wall of Israel,' being built by Sharon in order to protect ""passing schoolbusses from sniper-fire.""  He points out that much of the controversy over the path of the wall is around the Israeli city, aptly named, Ariel.    Although I love Safire's always appropriate and insightful comments, this time he misses a rather large issue: ISRAEL SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BUILD A WALL.  if the nobel peace prize winning Arafat's continued support of suicide bombings have caused the Israeli state such disruption that it has to protect school children by building a multi million-- probably billion--- dollar barrier between the Israeli's and the Palestinians, isn't that a sign that he should never have gotten the nobel peace prize?  (I recall Rudi's actions several years ago when Arafat came to New York to receive his Nobel: at the reception, Guiliani was seated at the man's table; when Arafat arrived, Bulldog Guiliani rose to his feet, said, ""I don't eat with murderers."" and left.  I love New York. But that's just a side story. )   The Bush Administration has threatened to withhold a guarantee of several million if Sharon moves the wall to protect Ariel (the City).  First of all, Baby Bush's handling of the Middle east peace process has been sloppy, at best.  But this one takes the cake.  Damn you Sharon, Damn you for being forced to protect schoolchildren from snipers."	m

"ok, so mean mamma is very slow at the uptake when it comes to humor. yesterday stephan and i launched into our fourth remake of our fishpond.  we dismantled everything, down through all 3 liners, including the original one that i installed after going to the chelsea flower show and deciding that i could not live without a water feature in my yard.  the liner i bought was small, which basically dictated that size and shape of my pond.  the liner that we bought yesterday was 12 x 12- stephan and i continue to enlarge the pond based on the generous size of said liner- we have acheived roundness and may reach oval status as we dig closer to the fence line.  stephan also had the bright idea to move the waterfall around to the side so it can be seen from the deck- did i tell you that my son is brilliant? anyway, back to the humor.  when ernst got home from work, stephan's first words to him were ""do you want to bring out the level?' it is so funny now- the next morning- in that when stephan and i launched into our brickwalk around the flowerbeds project- ernst kept trying to get us to use the level to make sure that the walks would be even.  we soon abandoned use of said level, because we were building on a hill anyway, and very few sections could be level anyway.  i don't think ernst caught on that stephan was actually making a joke out of the level- i certainly didn't catch on.........anyway- the fourth version of the lily pond is going to be tremendous......i certainly hope that we will not require version number 5..........."	f
Well the parents have left and gone home.  It's back to my crazy double life.  I get to be myself again now for the next 17 days until I go home to visit them.

"It snowed today! Wussy Seattle snow, but still. My office is up on the 32nd floor, so I got a great view of the blizzard, but most of it melts by the time it gets to street level. I WAS worried for a little while though, but then it abruptly stopped snowing.  New Year's...Eve? Is that what you call it? Katie and I are going over to Tim and Carrie's to party down. Andrew and Travis and Donnie will be there as well and we'll have a good time. New Years has always been a boring half-holiday for me. My dad would always drag me out on the porch and give me a small glass of wine and ask me what my resolutions were, then I'd roll my eyes and say, ""Nothing."" It's all a little cheesy making resoultions on a special day and whatnot, but I suppose if I was addicted to crack, it'd give me something shoot for, wouldn't it?   I've recently started drinking martinis. Not foofy ones, just vodka, vermouth, and maybe a little lemon. Shaken, not stirred. It gets you lit quick and tastes pretty good! I've even grown to enjoy a couple green olives in the drink. I've always hated black olives because they looked and smelled gross, but I can't say I've ever eaten a raw one. Eating is a lot about texture and appearance for me. Oysters are rather good, but they are so disgusting and slimey I can't bring myself to eat them. They look like cut-up baby hamsters.   Work on  ""Low to the Net""  is coming along very nicely. I've written two full scenes and have started a third. Writing as screenplay is taxing because you have to describe each shot, where the camera is and what the camera is doing. It's fun picturing the shot and how you want it to look though. This movie is a lot easier on me than a completley original one because it's basically a spoof on 80s movies. We're including, along with our sick love for ping-pong and our brilliantly retarded humor (You dorked my wife! I hate you!) , a mish-mash of 80s movie moments, so it's all recycled."	m

I like going to ice cream socials. I like ice cream, I like people, I like talking with people while eating ice cream. We are having an ice cream social today in the neighborhood to meet the new neighbors; I think this will be fun.   I doubt it will be as fun as the Coble Dairy Ice Cream Socials. Those are lots of fun! See Coble Dairy is the placedaddy worked at when I was a little girl. I loved going to work with him back in the day. I would play in his desk drawers all day and then after we went to lunchhe'd take me to the place where they kept the ice cream and i'd eat some. Then we'd go around and visit all the old men named Steve...most of the people who worked there were named Steve...I think...  Anyway, Pa had two secrataries and I like them a lot. One of them would take me to the bathroom whenI had to pee, she was my favorite one. The other one was always scared that I would fall down the stairs. I didn't like her much she was too paranoid. Those were fun times though.  Wellanyway then the lil business closed down so every year after thatall the ppl get back together and have a little ice creamsocial. The ice cream isn't great butI like the people. They all talk about me when I just little bitty, and all the old men named Stevejoke with daddy. I say they are his friends, but pa says he doesn't have any friends.  In Conclusion... I like ice cream socials. One day whenI old i mighteven hostone!	f

Last night my wife and I had two couples over for dinner.  They have both been visiting Greenwood Park for a while now (one has already placed membership).  We had a blast just sitting in our living room on the floor eating chilli.  We talked and laughed forever.  It was great getting to know them better.  Now I know why the early church, as recorded in Acts, went from house to house eating with glad and sincere hearts.  It is so much fun. Next time you get the chance, invite a visitor from church over for dinner.  It is great!	m

I think this may be the longest I've ever gone without posting. My apologies. I had a terrific opening weekend with the play I'm doing  Getting Away With Murder . We had a sold-out show on Saturday! I also had a wonderful date Saturday afternoon. We had lunch at the Clifton Diner and then rented  Lady and the Tramp . He has two Siamese cats named Si and Am...just like the movie, but he had never seen it. We watched the movie, listened to music and spent the afternoon talking  relaxing with each other. I can't remember such a wonderful afternoon/first date ever. He's such a sweet guy...not to mention handsome. Then, on Sunday, I flew to Omaha, Nebraska. Never been before. Probably will never go again. Glad to be back home in Cleveland!	m

"I'm working tonight so I can make up some hours for the week.  Tomorrow, before I go to work, I have my preop appointment.

I play more than one musical instrument, and type 70+ wpm.  I spent two years in art school.  You just never really realise how much you actually need your hands until you can't use one.  Try it sometime and see how difficult it actually is to get dressed or cook or eat or drive with one hand.  I learned this when I worked in rehab.  I'd work with people who were recovering from a stroke, trying to learn how to put on socks with one hand.  It's terribly difficult, and folks worked real hard to try and relearn basic things like coordinaton and balance.    Now, I have a good doctor and I don't anticipate any problems.  But still, it's my right hand, and it's making me a little nervous.  I so have to wonder also at the people who come and visit my blog every day or more than one time a day (there are people who do this, if you can believe it) and never leave a comment.  I've made it so easy.  Just click on the link that says ""BE PART OF THE REVOLUTION HERE"".  It's about interaction, people.  Talk to me a little bit.

"Y'know, at the Mandarin, there's this inter-franchise competition held every year where a group of judges just goes around all the Mandarins in Ontario (I think there's like 14) and they judge them on every aspect of the place. Food, service, cleanliness, how long it takes them to get seated, etc. etc.   Surprisingly we (Brampton) ranked 2nd among all of them overall.  In my division: Cleanliness, we scored top rank, so that means that the Brampton Mandarin is the cleanest Mandarin of them all... that's a little disconcerning :/  But at any rate, the good news is, is that I get a bonus!  Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!  Cash money!  So yeah, woo.    In news of fate, Liz has made a return, she was suppose to take the rest of the semester off, but I guess she changed her mind... and she happens to start on a Friday?  The same day that Peter works?  Coincidence? I think not.  Not only that, apparently every female that speaks to me in the Mandarin is my girlfriend.  Literally, I'm the the biggest mack in all of Mandarin :/  In reality, everyone is just making fun of me because I'm like the only single person there :(.  Bleh.  BLEH TO THEM!  Besides work, today sucked ass.  I went on today with only 3 hours of sleep, and the drive in the morning was horrible.  The wet sleet snow stuck onto my windshield as I was dropping my mom off to work, and the wipers weren't doing a really good job so I just let it be and drove with a translucent windshield.  My mom however, being somewhat concerned, and crazy at the same time, decides to press the wipers for me, even though it only makes it worse.  At one point, it got so bad, my windshield was fricken opaque.   OPAQUE.   I could only see brake lights.  I tore my mom's head off then.  I think I said something like ""What the hell?! Don't touch the damn wipers, you're only making it worse!""  Yeah, the rest of the ride was uncomfortable as ever.  If you're ever in the car with me, don't touch anything, I'll probably get really really pissed.  But it was because I was really grumpy from the lack of sleep already, and I hate it when people mess around with the car while I'm driving.  Got to school, did a crappy parking job, tried to stay awake in Bio, while complaining of my sleepiness.  Feel asleep in Math, then tried to do math, then I threatened to kill Ada, Devon and Jason.  They were all being their usual annoying selves, well, actually, Jason wasn't annoying, but he was in the vicinity and he's black, soooo it just felt good including him.  Chem was great, Mercier wasn't there, and I just knit the whole time.  Between all of this non-doing of stuff, my patience was non-existant, and so I was yelling a lot, or talking really loudly, and threatening to kill a lot of people.  Man, it felt good.    ""Shut the hell up Ada, I'm going to fucking kill you.  After that, I'm going to kill your mother.  Your father.  Your sister.  Then, I'll move onto your extended family, and I'll make sure I kill every last one of you.""  She thought I was joking, which I partially was, but I really really wanted people to shut up.  You know how Ada is... and Devon.. Devon is just a pain 99.999999999999999999999, hell he's a pain  ALL THE TIME .  He breathes way too loudly, and since he sits behind me, it's honestly one of the most disturbing things you can ever hear.  On normal days, with sleep, I can ignore things like this, but on days where I feel like killing people, it just doesn't flow.  On top of that, he has this habit of tapping his feet or hands or some sort of appendage really loudly on some hard surface.  Oh, I just wanted to wrangle is neck.  At lunch I exploded and used a chain of ""fucks"" to describe Ada and Devon.  It felt good to explode.    In English, omg, worst presentation ever.  I winged the entire piece of shit, and even then, I have to say, that was the worst presentation that I've done in my whole life.  Albiet, it wasn't as bad as about all the other presentations.  I also finished my ball of yarn in English, I casted off wrong, and fucked up my last row permentantly, so I just cut it off, and took out a row and now I'm back to square one.  I was going to cast off after school, but lots of people were telling me how my scarf was too short, so now I have to go back to Michaels and buy myself some more yarn.  Bleh, just when I thought I was done.  Oh, on my way to work, I had my scarf over my shoulders with the needles like jabbed inside the scarf.  I walked toward my car with Black Ruth, started it, and then dumped a bunch of stuff in the trunk, got in and drove away.  As soon as I got to the Mandarin, I realised I was missing a knitting needle.  I was like ""Oh my god, Where the fuck is the needle?""  where Black Ruth goes, ""You probably left it in the SAC Office.""  and I'm like ""They're not even mine! They're Hannah's! She's going to beat me, rape me then kill me if I lose one."" ""Yeah, but they're in the SAC office, so it's okay."" says Ruth.  Then I go ""Fine.""  I get changed and whatnot for work, where I'm already 20 minutes early, so I'm like, what if they  aren't  in the SAC office.  What if, I dropped them somewhere on the way towards my car, or worse yet, I dropped them in the school?.  I don't trust Black Ruth either, because her whole response was just to comfort me and get me to move on.  Clearly, she didn't even see them in the SAC office, and so, with that in mind, I ran to my car, jumped in, and drove back to the school quicktime.  I got to the parking lot, and to my surpise, the needle was right there, where I parked before.  Ruth was wrong.  Very Very wrong.  If I believed her, I would have lost Hannah's needle, and I would have been extremely upset and pissed off, and would have broke things.  Good thing I don't trust people, they're such liars.  Yeah, that's right, you're a liar.  On another note, the following people that I have to shop for and haven't even started:  Riyaad Hannah Aaron Andrea Sunny Luke Mom Dad Bro  Oh man I'm so fucked."	m
Not so much.  I just didn't really get much of a chance.  I tried to work on F-and-F on the bus trip to Boston, but the seats were way too cramped to work on her with The Boy sitting beside me.  I did start a swatch for the master knitting program...the seed stitch one (#3?  I don't have the sheet in front of me.)  The only reason I could is I bought shorter size 8 needles earlier that day...just for the sole purpose of knitting the swatches :-)  They'll be useful for scarves later.  It looks pretty decent.  I'll probably redo it anyway, because I'm having real problems getting my cast-on even.  You'd think I have plenty of practice now, but the whole time I've been knitting (including the knitting-a-whole-bunch-of-nothing when I was younger) I always used the knitted cast-on.  I could never get the hang of the basic one-needle one...none of the pictures I'd ever seen ANYWHERE made it make any sense to me.  Then a few weeks ago I told myself that I was going to learn it and I was going to like it.  I've nailed the first, and I'm making myself use it every time I cast on for something new, but I still don't have it perfectly even yet.  Which means I don't really like it yet.  (Any tips, anyone?)  Last night I managed to get a few rows done on Charlotte (I've started color 4!) and I started Sarah's HP scarf this morning.  I think I'm also going to make her a condom cozy (a la  urlLink summer Knitty ) in Slytherin colors.  Bwa ha ha.	f

June 11, 2004  Sorry to have been such a deadbeat about updating. I have been no better and no worse than usual, which, while not awful, ain’t great, either. But I do have fabulous news to report: my cholesterol numbers are in! My ‘before’ numbers came from mid-November, while my ‘after numbers were from sometime mid-May – so almost exactly six months. My total cholesterol has dropped from 253 (originally I thought it was 252) to 188!! My triglycerides dropped from 197 to 93!! My LDL dropped from 152 to 111!! And lastly, my HDL (or ‘good’ cholesterol) dropped from 62 t0 58, but it’s a small drop given the overall huge drop I took in total cholesterol. And besides, my HDL is still way higher than most people’s. So, how cool is that? Every one of my numbers is in a perfectly healthy range.  I’ve decided to do a little two-week stringent dieting to kind of kick-start me again. The thing is, BFL works so fucking well and every time I’m getting really hungry, it’s time to eat again. So it’s a genius plan, if you ask me. I have no idea why I feel the need to do anything else, but I do right now. The SBD cookbook was just too damned fishy for me. There’s no way I’m cooking that much seafood. I don’t really like it, and besides, I’m not rolling in dough.  My neighbor Jen is doing SO WELL on Weight Watchers. I am just so proud of her. But then, she  is  working her ass off. Literally, ha ha! (Oh, I slay me.) The woman gets up at the butt-crack of dawn to work out the vast majority of mornings…which is what I used to do and need to do again. It felt good to be up on that moral high ground, heh heh.  So, anyway – you’re probably going to be getting some mighty cranky posts from me in the next few days. Like I said, I don’t do diets well. Snarl…	f
"Karma Fool read an article recently in   urlLink Scientific American   that discussed how the sheer number of choices with which we are faced can--far from freeing us up to a world of opportunities--can, in fact, paralyze us:  urlLink Scientific American: The Tyranny of Choice         One partial solution that Karma Fool has to the information overload dilemma is scanning, and if then adequately intrigued, reading, news, blogs entries and other Internet site information through a so-called ""news aggregator.""  News aggregators come in many forms, but what they all, in essence do, is collect information for Internet sources into one easily accessible location on your computer.  The aggregators scan the Internet sites that the user designates and looks for new information.  When it finds new information, it collects it.  Karma Fool then needs to only open his aggregator, instead of visiting countless Web sites.   I found that not all aggregators are created equal.

"This is great. I finally have a blogger thing. Now all you people out there can really get to know me deeper than what you can get from my website. The first thing I want to talk about is my new commercial that I landed. It's forStar Wars: Battlefront, which I hear is a new videogame that will be coming out on PC, XBOX and PS2. I'm excited because it's a national commercial that will be played on Cable, Network and in foreign markets. Plus it's a funny commercial, which hopefully will mean more airtime and MONEY! This is my second national commercial in the past 2 months. My last commercial was for PS2 Online. The videogame industry is being very generous to me lately, which works for me since I've spent hundreds of dollars on videogames and PS2 stuff. So it's time I got my money back.  The audition for the commercial was great. I showed up and read the sides and it said that one of the characters was obviously out-of-shape, which is PC for obviously fat. I knew my chances of getting the commercial just went up 50%. Usually when I audition for stuff, I try and look as thin as possible, wearing loose shirts and blankets, etc. Having lost 50 pounds in the past year (Thank you ATKINS), I was worried that I would come across as too anorexic on camera with my 260+ pound body. So when I read the script I tore off my lose shirt and auditioned in my thin, belly hugging undershirt. And in auditions they make you do a profile shots where you face the camera then turn to the left and then the right, very similar to a prison line-up where they make you do your profiles. I don't know if they make everyone do this at an audition or if they did this especially for me to make me feel more at home. But as I did my profiles, I made sure to try and stick out my stomach to appear as much as Buddha as possible. Apparantly it worked because I landed the role later that week.  The only bad part is that I was suppose to go down to LA and perform at the Conga Room the same day as the commercial shoot (which is Monday, July 26th). The show is for consideration to be in this new documentary on latino stand up comedians, called ""standUP"". Unfortunately, I had to cancel. Hopefully I can reschedule for the following Monday.  Well this is my first Blog. I like this. I will try and post stuff alot and hopefully someone will eventually read it."	m

The Man who created the world as we see it today   A couple of years back, the BBC ran a show called “The Greatest Britons of them all”. Or something to that effect.   I did manage to see most of the episodes in that series, and it was very interesting, real good programming.  The important thing was the selection of candidates, who were on “show” literally. Winston Churchill Lady Di Isaac Newton John Lennon Charles Darwin William Shakespeare Oliver Cromwell Queen Elizabeth I Horatio Nelson Isambard Kingdom Brunel  My personal favorite was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, probably the least “known” off the lot. He was the finest, visionary engineer of the Industrial Revolution.   If the Industrial Revolution could be compartmentalized into two distinct constituents. The social-economic factors/fallouts, and its associated politics. AND the real engineering itself. The Manufacturing, building, planning, visioning, Brunel was God. He was the nuts and bolts man who dreamt and created with the drawing board as his canvas.  He engineered the underwater tunnel across the Thames; he built over 1000 miles of Railways, and three steam ships each of which when built, were at their time the largest sea vessels in the world! And a lesser known fact is that, he was the Consultant Engineer during the building of the Railways in India and Australia.  And if that is not enough, he was the creator of the broad gauge railway as is used all over the world now and also created a fairly environmental friendly “atmospheric rail system”, which propelled trains using compressed air pipes instead of conventional rail tracks with fossil fuel guzzling engines charging up and down. But unfortunately this met with limited success.   The reason I admire the man most is for his bridges. He built over a 100 of them in his life time, from small corner stone ones measuring a few meters, to arch wonders half a mile long. The man was commissioned to extend the railways, and as he went about his task of building tracks and making stations, he encountered the pesky problem of rivers, rivulets and man made obstacles. And the “bridge building” he had to undertake, is the forerunner to the nearly all the bridge designs that we know and use today.   When he already was acclaimed as a pioneer in railway engineering, he set his eyes on steam ship building. The biggest problem at that time was building steam ships which could actually store enough coal to propel the engines, during a Trans Atlantic journey. Brunel designed a steamship “The Great Western”, which he argued could carry enough coal to fuel the engines for a Trans Atlantic journey. Though the Great Western wasn’t the first steam ship to actually make the Trans Atlantic journey, the Sirius first made the trip from London to New York. The Great Western docked at New York only two days later, but had taken 15 days as opposed to the Sirius ‘s 19, and the Great Western reached with over 200 tonnes of coal to spare, while the Sirius towards the end of its journey, had to actually burn its cargo to feed its engines, as it had run out of coal!  His last project was the steamship “The Great Eastern”, it was the most ambitious maritime project of the century. The ship was 700 feet long and weighed close to 20,000 tonnes! For the next fifty years no ship was conceived/designed on even paper to match “The Great Eastern”. Entire docks and ship building yards had to be extended to accommodate a ship construction of this magnitude.   After many financial problems, the ship did set sail, but on its second day an engine room mishap claimed five lives. An accident caused entirely out of human error as opposed to a design/manufacture flaw. Nonetheless the accident was tragic, Brunel died a week later.	m
"Haha Rob, I'm not sure if I understood your last post correctly, but it seems like it was full of metaphors and analogies. First of all, GAAAAA the oxymoron combinations of Leftist/Fascist/SuicideBomber/Know-Nothing political jargons mixed with some of your peculiarly molded mind has transplanted the great picasso like abstarct ideas into our fantastic debate blog. Emerson would laugh so hard.  Secondly, I think you were the first person to mention that gay people are more loving than heterosexuals. ""Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher. Marriage is something that this group has to fight for"". Although I don't deny that statement at all.  Third of all, for affirmative actions, I think Asians (especially oriental Asians) are as bad, or even worse than caucasians in lot of cases. Go figure. I actually wish I was white. Heh being a minority without the minority benefits and without the majority race ADVANTAGES is like a bogus race to me. WOH NEXT NINE HOURS KNOW-NOTHING SUPPORTERS PLEASE JOIN ROB MUILENBURGE!

A song by Arkarna.     You could be popular. You could be wanting more. It doesn't have to be that way. This could be beautiful. Are you really gonna make it happen? Seems a whisper's sometimes louder than a scream. Are you really gonna make it happen? Life is free.  You could be a checkout girl. You could be beautiful. You give your all but it's not enough. Is that just the way it is? Are you really gonna make it happen? Seems a whisper's sometimes louder than a scream. Are you really gonna make it happen? Life is free.  Keep the dream alive, don't be afraid. I'm suffering my life away. That's all I've got to say.  You can make it happen. You can make it happen. You can make it happen.	m

"Where Dreams Go to Die  I found an old CD of the late, great Harry Chapin I'd burned back in the ""free Napster"" days.   Most of his songs are powerful and poignant, but one in particular grabs me in these days. It's  urlLink about the cleaner from Ohio  who loves to sing and is encouraged to give it a shot on the professional stage. He's the best singer in Dayton, but it's an entirely different story when he goes to New York for his big debut. In one succinct review, Mr. Tanner's dreams are shattered, and his life is sucked out of him.   He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends. Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again, Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed. He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes. Music was his life, it was not his livelihood, And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good. And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul. He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.   Ever feel like that?"	m
Mom is here to save the week but as I am finding out the change of life is not very good to her.  Last night she not only had two fans on in the room but insisted on opening both windows to let the room get to a bone chilling 35 degrees and yet she still got up in the middle of the night to fan herself off from night sweats.  Is this what we have to look forward to!!	f
"An hour dissapeared today, although in reality, time never actually dissapeares, it merely occurs.  Well, time is just a concept really, it doesn't actually have any existence at all.  But whatever.. enough trying to be smart, I'll leave JP and Josh to do that.  I just watched  urlLink Lost in Translation , and I really liked it.  I mean when someone says fifty million words, and the translator just responds with ""Look at camera"", that's rich.  I dunno, the movie is very melancholy though, there isn't really a climax, an ending, nor a beginning.  Well, there is literally.. but.. yea.. you know what I mean..  It's a really good movie, although, you really need to pay attention as the quirkiness and the jokes are very subtle and if you aren't on the ball you'll miss out on a lot.  I have to say, the movie gets mucho points for it's uniqueness and it's ability to capture ""real-life""-like moments, awkward pauses et al.  It's really good, I sware, but if you're looking for action... go watching something else :p  Anyway, good movie, to cap off a good night.  Hannah's party roxored, Asian theme - lol... funny shizzle and like 50 million different fruit smoothies... and what has got to be the most drawn out movie ever (a brown movie)... oh man it was like 3 hours of crazy falling in love business and people dying of heart disease and other crazy gay jokes.  Hiliarous, but shit, this isn't Le Mans, people.    Yeah, I didn't know White Rose was going out of business until today when I got a house-warming plant/flower/thing.  In any case, tonight has been good, as well as the previous night, with the Ruth's LaserQuesting and Steve getting his ass soaked.  Man, I really could use that hour though..."	m
The Best Little Warehouse  Tuesday it all went into storage.  Most of it, anyway.  At 9am, two movers and one fairly big truck came to haul away my boxes and crates and bags full of books and clothes and kitchen stuff and Goddess knows what else.  And, believe it or not, it all went pretty smoothly.  I was determined to make the two and a half hour minimum for the move, so at about 7am I started moving stuff downstairs myself.  My building (soon to be my  old  building) was built in the early twenties, so it has an old, manually operated service elevator.  As Choire had predicted last Sunday when he came over to taunt me as I packed, some of the boxes were overstuffed and structurally unsound.  But it's amazing what extra packing tape can do.  I was dripping with sweat by the time the movers got here, but I'd cut there job in half, so they pretended not to notice I looked like some sort of manic convict.  Even though most of my belongings were in boxes (but clearly marked...I am a Virgo, after all), it's a strange sensation to have people walk by them, appraising them, asking if I'm moving, wondering how many boxes there are, is any of it for sale...  I felt a little like Scrooge watching his belongings being picked over after his death.  But finally the last of it was being loaded onto the big truck and I called Jon Jordan to let him know I'd be picking him up in a cab so we could meet the movers at Chelsea Storage.  Ah, Chelsea Storage.  Right on the West Side Highway, Jon and I used to bike by it on our morning rides.  It's massive.  Floors and floors now of storage units of different sizes.  We determined what size I'd need and Jon and I went to go look at the unit.  The first they showed us had a window in it and I was concerned that it might break and rain or snow all over my rare books.  So they showed us a second one and I took it.  8x10.  A fitting size for an actor.  We filled out the endless paperwork and went up to move things into the space.  An interesting thing has been happening during my remaining time in the City.  Much like Scrooge, I'm being reminded of people and places that have passed through my life during the past 18 years.  The trip up to my storage unit is no different.  In order to get to that part of the warehouse, you have to walk through what used to be The Tunnel, a nightclub I used to frequent as a lad.  I was disoriented at first.  I mean, we'd been walking through brick warehouse and suddenly the walls are painted silver, there's the dj booth, the dancefloor, the former Kenny Scharf room...all kinds of memories were attacking my senses.  That's the spot where Stephen and I chatted with Michael Musto, who was clutching a straw purse with big plastic flowers, for 40 minutes until he realized he really didn't know us and then just walked away.  The dancefloor where I really learned to love Junior, and where I once took two straight boys for their first taste of Manhattan clubbing and drugging.  The Kenny Scharf room where for some reason I got free drinks all night and where we'd go to recover a bit from the mayhem of the dance floor.  And here I was strolling through this in the middle of the morning, around the time I used to leave, on my way to put my life into a container so I could leave New York.  Very strange.  Up on the sixth floor, the movers were already starting to put my stuff into the new space.  I, of course, wanted to do it all myself (I had a Magic Marker in my pocket ready to re-label for easy identification and access.  Also, since I knew what was in which box, I wanted to make sure things were stacked properly and sensibly.  Now, I know I was in a little bit of a hurry towards the end of my storage packing (I'm still packing what I'm taking and what I'm tossing, plus a second, smaller wave of storage), but I guess somewhere I'd packed a  urlLink Furby  (don't ask) but forgotten to remove his batteries and everytime that particular box was jostled, he'd started muttering and gurgling.  Initially, the Jamaican mover hadn't wanted to touch the box, assuming (probably rightly) that I had some bad mojo in it.  Well, after I told Jon and the movers that they should just go, since I was only gonna shift boxes around, he was the only company I had.  If it got too quiet, I'd just knock the box and he'd start singing and babbling.  It probably should've been annoying, but I kinda enjoyed the company...he was certainly more coherent than many of my previous companions at The Tunnel.  About an hour later, I stepped back and looked at it all.  The better part of the last 18 years, neatly boxed and labeled, and I didn't understand it any better than I had before.  But at least it was now safe.  No one could come to my apartment and toss it out onto the street because I hadn't paid rent.  I breathed a smallish sigh of relief, closed the door and snapped the lock.  As I was waiting for the elevator to come, all alone on the sixth floor of this huge warehouse, I could hear Furby sneezing and muttering to himself.  As surreal as it was, it made me laugh.  At least my life's not boring.  Got back to the apartment, looked around and...well, it didn't look that much emptier.  Still a lot of furniture and papers and clothes and so much dog hair I could knit my own litter.  But a big chunk, an important chunk, was out of the way.  One more step closer to being a resident of the fine State of Louisiana.	m

whats good yall  tomorrow is a bring your own glass/shot glass event, and if you bring your own alcohol please bring enough to share, even if you dont share alot. i say bring your own glass/shot glass because im pretty sure bob cant hand out enough glass wear for everyone. i will be bringing extra shot glasses, but bring yoour own if you have one. also, ill give everyone 3 freeshots of baileys for carbombs and what not, but this shit set me back 40 bucks and i need a little profit... so say maybe a dollar a shot after? it will prolly be kicked after everyone gets thier free ones anyway but if not after that i need to charge (except bob and kev and jay, they are free all night). also someone needs to buy like a 12 pack or a 18 pack of guiness.. were going to be doing 3/4 pints for the car bombs so it will work out to be extra in the end but if we dont have it we cant to it. who ever buys tha guiness gets freeshots.  thanks guys darin	m

Left school a while ago... for the holidays!! :D  Very cool day, well, if you can call it a day.  Zak brought in his water gun, and the teachers were too dumb to realise it poking out of his bag all day lol.  The only lesson today where we actually did some work was geography, typical Mrs. Marsh.  We watched a few videos and messed around in other lessons, pretty pointless going in at all I suppose.  I've got a right old elephant for my next school tutor and it's gonna suck.  I got a few awards in assembly and I wasn't suprised that Mrs. Marsh chose two girls for her awards, again, typical old Marshy!  I'm having a barbeque tonight (in aid of my Mum's and Sheldon's engagement) and then I'm going my dad's for the weekend.  I'm gonna be packing for my hols on Monday and Tuesday and then jetting off on Wednesday :)  I better go and get ready for the barbeque...cya	m

It like i like. :D I like the way he sends me lil kisses when we talk and how he does the lil love smiley face and then says ""xoxoxox"" awwwww lol I love the way he looks at me i love the way he makes me feel period. Theres never a dull moment with Lorne. :) It all just seems too good to be true. I wrote earlier how freakin tired of i was being single and how i wish i was prettier or guys liked me more, and just when i want it the most it comes to me. Maybe it was meant to be that way. Tonite i HAD to tell lorne by cuz i had to do some hw and i cant do it while im talkin to him cuz..well...lol i cant think about ne thing else. So, it took me literally 15mins to say bye. haha everytime i said ok im going and send him a kiss he would say something and i would say something and we would just keep going back and forth. He kept doing his kissies and his hugs and his xoxoxo and his love smileies. He finally said ""damn its hard to say bye to u"" lol :D haha yeah, its hard to say bye to him too. It's like i could talk to him forever and hang out with him for EVER AND EVER. I really care about him and well his best friend added me tonite and said that lorne told him we were already dating. Um..i thought we were just ""talking"" but hey, i dont care!! Whatever lorne wants to think we are. lol Naw, he prob just told his friends that...idk...he told his little cousin that too. His little couins is 9 and has me on his list also. he popped up today and said ""hey lornes girlfriend, i hear ur hot"" lol yeah ok lil 9yr old. He then tells me how there is a lil girl in his class that looks like a monkey and i die laughing. i tell him to be nice because one day that monkey will be really pretty and he'll want to date her. his response to that was ""you mean like you and lorne??"" lol he then asks what i look like and tell him i look like a monkey. he argues with me for 5mins over if i look like a monkey or not. I say ""yeah i do"" he says ""no you dont"" he finally gives up and says  I KNOW U DONT LOOK LIKE A MONKEY CUZ LORNE SAID SO lol so i give in and say ok ok ok maybe im not a monkey. He was cute, but lorne thinks hes annoying. then this 9yr old started calling me babe and stuff and lorne got onto to him telling him he was gonna kick his tail if he messed with his girl...wow...HIS GIRL. im lornes girl!!! YAY!! lmao hehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehe"	f
Today after church we had a swim party at one of them members house. That was a lot of fun.

I've known the person a while but I got to know her a lot better. Makes me think...and its scary when I start to think lol...Anyways...today my lil friend from church got me a late birthday present. This boy is a lil longhorn boy and when he gave me the present I was surprised because it was in an A bag, had an A card, and all A stuff...it was pretty cool. Might end up getting him recruited to A by the time he gets outta elementary...hah...anyways...I'm bored...I hurt...and I'm hungry...Ill catch yawl later!	m

i was having lunch today and my dad started getting on my nerves again with the way he eats. it's not such a big deal itself, he makes noise whenever he opens his mouth to eat, more people do that. but it doesn't get on my nerves because it's gross, it only gets on my nerves when my dad does it, not when other people do it. why? because i find it obscene when it's him. the way he half sticks out his tongue to put the food on it, the way he often quickly darts the tip of his tongue to the corners of his lips with his mouth half open, all this is SO obscene! i can't stand it anymore. each and every time it happens it brings me back to when i was a kid and i went on vacation with my parents. we all slept in the same room to save money and my parents used to have sex with me right there, not even checking if i was asleep. these obscene noises i kept hearing night after night have followed me through the years.  back then, whenever i protested that i wanted to sleep my dad would just get mad and say i wanted to split them. i didn't realize it then, but i felt totally left out, ignored, like i was unimportant. like he was stealing my mom, as he was always the one starting the sex sessions. my mom was all i had back then. i often tried to talk to her about that problem but i felt too ashamed and never actually told her. i couldn't get the words out of my mind. it was like being forced to hear porn every night, and when you're 11 to 15 years old it's not good, believe me. when i think about it now, i feel like i was being abused. i've never really told anyone about this, and i hope nobody will judge me here.   i can't bring that topic back to my parents now, what's done can't be undone, i know that's what they will tell me -they have told me this other times about other problems. what can i do to forget that? it's not like it's a problem in my life, it's not -i've had boyfriends, i've had sex... maybe it's the cause of some very weird sexual fantasies i have, but that's about it. but it does contribute to the hate i still keep inside towards my dad. we've never had a good relationship until a couple of years ago, but recently i've felt my hate for him coming back sometimes. i need to live on my own, damnit! maybe then things will get better on that side! but for now i really can't afford it.	f
Schiggity?  Schwa.  Battle of the Bands was really fun, and 30 Seconds Late had a real hit with Megalomaniac.  It sucks that Jake Stark's guitar got unplugged.  I think I've talked about Jake hear before....  anyway.  Sonja left on sunday, and so did her kung fu buddy and Ryan.  I only saw all of them together this weekend for a collective.. 15-20 minutes.  Awesome... Sonja's been a bitch.  Then I played the grip of Painkiller, which was awesome, what with the zombie ninjas and the zombie Nazi's and my arsenal of 100 rockets.  PEOPLE CAN FLY! And, coincidentally, be blown into small pieces.   I can play Painkiller online, even though I got it off of Deviance (hahaha)  Today was mellow.  Good.  I need less drama.  I guess it can be said that life is drama.  To say you're done with drama is to stop being alive.  Both metaphorically and physically.  I just want to be slightly sedated/have less drama.  Not a complete lack thereof, of course.  Buuh.  What? Yeah, ok.	m
"So being selfish has it's benefits obviously.  My whole life theme right now is that I don't want to date anyone seriously and that I want to concentrate on learning more about myself and pretty much live my life like it's all about me, all the time.  I have been pretty successful at being selfish, as I am an only child, and I know how not to share. Even as an animal lover, my thoughts of owning a pet when I move into my new house, makes me ill!  I mean, I can't have an animal who will shit on my new $6,000 carpet!!!   As of late, my life theme has gone down the shitter.  I have/am completely been lustful lately, which is nice, but it's blurring the the line and I have now created this grey area which is ARG! I am trying not to be completely engulfed by my lust and function at work as if I am not falling for someone.  However, it's tough not to think about being in lust when the lustful object comes to Boulder just to take me to lunch.  YIKES!  Oh but how dreamy it is to be taken care of... but wait, I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!  Oh but it's nice to have a day off and have someone else take care of you.  WAKE UP!  LUST IS DISTRATING, especially when the lustful object of my affection is hot!    Funny how my selfishness attracts some and repels others.  For example, I had several requests for hot dates the past few months, but most of my female friends can't even stand me right now.  Except Caitlin.  We are on the same track right now.  We are content with where we are in life, doing our own thing, being strong women, loving the attention we receive from men, but love and would prefer hanging out rather than having to answer to someone/anyone.  And we know, in the end, we will turn out the ""better wives"" because we took the chance to be selfish now, rather than later.  I mean, who wants a women who wasn't selfish in her 20's and is now wanting to be selfish with 2 kids!?!  NO ONE!  DAMN, I'm SMART!    Speaking of selfish, go to www.feelmypain.net.  This guy is selfish which in turn, makes a neighborhood insane and everyone then turns on him.  Even the kids.  This guy has a lot of time on his hands and really needs to get laid, get out more and realize that if you move to Highlands Ranch, children are expected.  I mean, Douglas County is the fastest growing county in the USA.  DUH! Plus, it's Highlands Ranch, track housing is what HR does.  Random:  I went to the Toad.  A cool little quasi dive bar in Littleton.  I had a blast. Live music, cheap drinks.  I went with the new guy, we'll call him Lustin, and his exgirlfriend, yes that's right, his ex who is also my good friend and my old roommate and her boyfriend.  Actually, I love this girl (the ex).  She is positively the sweetest girl I know.  Her boyfriend is lucky to have her!  The whole thing with Lustin and the Ex is kind of a sticky situation!  They ended on a bad note but have recently become friends ago.  We had fun, once we drank.  :-)  Can you tell the Boss and most of my other coworkers are gone today?  I can!  Enjoying the view from my office.  I love wandering off into the wild world of the internet.    The Avalanche have a new coach.  Jo Quinnville.  Good stuff.  Guess we will see his coaching ability in 2005.  ARG.  If the NHL won't play, I will go to the DU games.  YEP.    Mom was in a rotten mood last night.  I can't see why?  I cleaned her house and the bathroom and did laundry.  I think she misses Don.  BARF.  He will be back in a few days.    Okay, need to work..."	f

The moment the bas drove down the mountain, I know I gonna miss the snow and the snowboarding....and my heart broke more when I turned back to look at the beautiful sunset: the whole mountain was pink!    Well..this was a very dramatic trip! First Yit and I flew back from KL to Melbourne and left the same night at 2 am to Falls Creek. Upon arrival (early in the morning), we went snowboarding straight away, without proper breakie or even rest. The weather was beautiful and the snow was soft. Everything looked perfect. But after lunch, the weather turned bad. Yit and I was bold enough to try the intermediate tracks even we were beginners; We snowboardedat different trails even the visibility was only around 2km. Guess what? We were LOST! We couldn't find our way, and had to take off our board and started walking...but good thing we manage to get back to one of the biggest meeting point...well....we continued boarding despite of the incident. to think of it, maybe we shoudn't....because the next thing that happened was Yit broke his wrist!! It was our last trail and we were heading back to our rooms. I arrived at the bottom of the slope and fell. Yit was behind me, and after I got up and moved, Yit fell at the same spot (damn spot!). It wasn't until the next morning that we got to the doctors and were told that clinically his wrist was broken. (Stupid hotel reception that told us, the medical center will only attend to patient with life and death situation after 5.30pm)! My poor cousin who had to suffer with the pain that whole night!    The next morning - BAD WEATHER....all ski lift were close except one, windy and bad visibility. So, in a way, it was good for Yit and I because we spend half the morning at the medical center!    The last day, I made the full out of it, snow boarded alone although it was extremely dangerous to do so. I had no choice because my other friends were not as daring and as bold as me. But I was pretty careful this time, to control my speed and improve my breaking skills. I didn't want to end up like Yit..    Well, we had steamboat and tepanyaki for dinners (we carried everything from Melbourne to the mountains mind you - there were 8 of us in the group; Yit, Moon, Rick, Kevin, Aunty Virna, Vivian and Si Hui). Food was yummy!    Oh not forgetting to mention, the world is so small, because we ended meeting Vincent's good buddies. They were our neighbour and ended up having dinner with us.    Thanks guys, you all made the trip worth going although there was bad weather. All help contributed -esp moon doing the groceries is highly appreciated!!!!    and now, the end of my ski trip, back to reality - clean my room, eat, sleep and enjoy. I have got one more week before i have to start putting in 200% effort to study!!	f
"I recently saw one concert featuring the following bands:  One World Tribe (a Reggae band from Buffalo (I think) Andrew WK The Used The Roots  My assessment of this show. One world tribe put on a good reggae show, I have seen them once before and they were good then too. Andrew WK was awesome. His music is straight up metal and his lyrics are very simple and usually deal with partying and having fun. You can't even understand what he says but it doesn't matter because he is such an awesome on stage presence. He stands about 6'4"". He is white. He has stubble and long brown hair. He wears a dirty white t-shirt and dirty white jeans. It's clear that he hasn't showered in a few days. During the show, he encourages fans to climb up on stage. While on stage, he gives them the mic and lets them sing, and sometimes he even puts them on his shoulders. When he's not partying with the fans, he swings his arms all over the place, does a lot of cheerleader kicks and spins. He even did a song called, ""I love Buffalo"", which I think he wrote that day. The final song he allowed about 20 people on stage. It wasn't violent or anything, just a lot of energetic jumping around. The fans were just really excited to participate in the show.   Then the used came on. The suck my ass so bad. Your typical ""suck ass alt-nu-rock-emo-bullshit I am gay music"" that is being played on modern rock radio stations these day. Each song was sandwiched between a stupid little phrase about what this song means to him. For instance, ""This is a song about being lonely, I know everyone in here has been lonely at least once."" Plus the lead singer dated kelly osbourne which makes him even more annoying because he thinks he's extra special.  Anyway, then came the headliner, the roots. Whoever was running the soundboard was doing a terrible job. The appeal of the roots is that they are a hip hop group that has a real live backing band, with guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and turntables. No drum machines or anything. So I was expecting a really smooth, jazzy, hip hop feel. For some reason, however, the vocals were cranked up really really loud and you couldn't hear any of the instruments playing. All you could hear was the percussiveness of the lyrics. It was like listening to the radio on a crappy boombox thats turned up way too loud. We left after about 4 songs, because the sound was that bad. I am going to see the roots again in the summer at field day fest, so maybe they'll put on a better show then.  Then the next night I went to akron, ny to fred's house. His parents were out of town so his sister threw a party. At this party, I met some of the weirdest people, EVER. This party had everything: it had a guy on the couch that slept the whole time, a guy that used ""@#%$"" in every sentence, a guy named, a guy that laughed at everything, and a guy that explained to us the fastest way to get out of being in the navy without saying you're gay. I don't think I'm really doing this party justice, because my primitive writing skills can't describe it. I will just say that I am convinced that Fred Schrock is the smartest man in Akron, New York...EVER.  PS Shout out to scotty. let's go to fuji grill."	m

Mildly frustrated.  Beneath it all, everything's ok. But there are just minor annoyances.  I have a piano master class Thursday that I'd better prepare for: it's the Ravel and hence the possibility for crazy mixed up notes, tangled fingers, etc. And it's Nancy Bricard. Sigh. I hope practice for the rest of the week won't mimic what happened this afternoon: after a shower, I decided I was tired. And slept until the piano lesson, no time to warm up. Sleep is good. Even when your hair is wet and you know you have to wake up in half an hour.  That was deep.  But I'm better now, albeit tired. Tutoring lasted longer than I expected, and I think both teacher and student were tired by session's end. Yawn.  And sometimes you just start talking to people and everything they say is a rebuff despite your crystal clear good intentions. It just has to keep you on your toes, I suppose. And some people are just positively down, and I have no way to help it. Some people are way too happy for their own good and you just can't match their bubbliness. Some people will use you and they will only demand.  I have yet to meet a pensive type like me who rarely talks. That's a good thing, though...it means that I'll have some sort of conversation wherever I go, and as the quiet one I can regulate it. It's just a matter of keeping up, of changing pace, of dealing.  Sadly, I think I need to start assigning numbers to every person I overanalyze so I can just keep track and remind myself how crazy this all is. It's all mental, though, which is what kills me: there will be nothing palpable I can stare at and investigate. Even that is scary. Even worse is that now I toss around something that doesn't even exist, and I make a game out of it.  So now I really wonder what I do in my free time. Either I spend it on the computer making worthless conversation that probably fuels my wild imagination, or I fall asleep. Or I do homework, or eat...speaking of which, I should start watching what I'm eating. And then there's that perennial if: IF I COULD DRIVE/had a car, I'd pop in the Postal Service and...go to Barnes and Noble. Yes, that's a safe choice.  And Mom starts doubting my college abilities. Maybe I thought I was too invincible in the past, but she's starting to get on my case again about APs and that 6-year med program at USC and blah blah blah. The only gem from that conversation: I love the Cheungs. I'd pay good money to have a family like that.  Sometimes I think I'm missing so many things.  Listen to the Postal Service.	f

"hi again. so this weekend i bought this veet hair removel stuff just to try it out. well the package says to read all the safety precausions first, so i did. who knew this stuff was so dangerous? i used it anyway, so i put it on and every thing was fine. ten it started to burn every time i moved. so i started to get a little scared but again i waited it out. then i washed it off to find my legs really, really smooth, this pleased me. but the rest of the day my legs kept burning pretty badly. im not very smart.  ok, so today we had this creepy sub in math and he couldnt turn on the tv so we couldnt see the morning show. oh well. outside my math room my social studies teacher is giving away these stickers to remind our parents to vote tonight, so me and jess went to get some and i was really happy. then the creepy sub was trying to teach us this thing about the other thing that i forgot. then some kid was close to getting the answer but didnt get it so the sub was like close but no cigar. and i asked him if he was premoting smoking. he said no.

Hey all,   Well I wnet for my physical testing today at Honda and it went pretty well.  I think I did good at it and I think I did well at the hand/eye coordination test thanks to all the video gaming I've done over the years.  So now it's just the waiting game to see if they want me.  I think it's looking good as the physical test was supposed to take about 90 minutes to complete and I did it in 70 minutes.  The only problem that I can forsee is they straped a heart rate monitor to my chest and after a particular grueling exercise I had to wait a minute for my heart rate to go down.  We'll see though.  So now they have to check my references and score me on my interview which I believe I did very well in.  Then I'll get the call for yea or nay...  I'll keep you posted    urlLink  postCount('108921442228207073');    |  urlLink  postCountTB('108921442228207073');	m

"So I checked AccuWeather to see what the forecast for the weekend is. AccuWeather informs me that Saturday will see ""Rain, then a shower possible.""  I know, I focus on semantics too much, but this is a truly perplexing weather forecast. If it is raining, then how do we differentiate rain from a shower? Is there a meteorological phenomenon known as a 'shower'?  Whatever it means, I expect tomorrow to be wet, with intermittent spells of wet, followed perhaps, by more wet."	f
"Next week I have a birthday coming up. I'll be a  urlLink big  23 year old. And so, considering its my birthday, I've been thinking about the other end of this big 'ole spectrum: Death. And more importantly, funerals. Should I ever be bumped off in the near future (be it by the mob, or an enraged spurned lover), I have a few requests for my funeral.  1) I want a bouncer at my funeral. The purpose of whom will be to keep all the ugly people out. This is my moment where people are fully focused on me. I've never had much tolerance for the ugly in my life, why should it be any different in death? I'm a shallow man, and I want my funeral to reflect this.  2) Music-wise. There's only one band ever to grace Gods green earth that is worthy enough to have their tunes played at my funeral.  urlLink Dr Teeth And The Electric Mayhem . What could be more fitting than the stirring tunes of ""manah ma na"" being played as my coffin is laid to rest?  3) Never do I wear a suit. Therefore, why should I be buried in one for all eternity? Put me in a pair of jeans, a shabby shirt, and preferably, no shoes. On a side note, do you think many nudists are buried in clothes? Food for thought.  Funerals just aren't personalised enough, in my opinion."	m

BLOGMATES GRAB YOUR DIGITAL CAMERAS because we've got a new weekly RWBS challenge!!     (Note: you can use either a digital camera, your webcam, your mobile phone camera, or you can scan in a pic taken in 35mm film)  The game will be played like I Spy --  every Friday a hint/topic to photograph will be revealed, and each blogmate will be required to post a photo in response on the following Monday (giving us the weekend to complete the task), and the result of which will be a photo essay of our collective efforts.  The 'assignments' will be broad enough in nature to accommodate all types of digital cameras (i.e., you can take the pics inside/outside with a digital camera or camera phone, or you can take the pics at home with your webcam).  [For example, one hint/topic could be to take pics of something of a specific color like  RED  -- you could take and post a picture of red flowers, a pic of you in your favorite red shirt, a pic of someone with red hair, or even a pic of red lipstick stains on a napkin.]  The topics will be randomly chosen (and by 'random' I mean that each week a new letter of the name of our blog will be used to create a topic), and  the first assignment will be posted this  Friday  .	m

"that ep of friends was on yesterday. and i'm watching a mini-marathon of cheers.  rant topic: what is the best thing ever?  not the best movie, or book, or activity, or show. but best thing  ever.  for instance, is the book  ender's game  better than the movie  mystic river , or photoshop, or singing? it's hard to compare stuff. but i bet most people would say something that's not acctually a physical thing...  romantics might say ""obviously love is the greatest thing ever. love lifts us up! all you need is love!"" or they'd say ""friendship is God's gift. nothing is greater than friendship."" which, in my opinion, tend to be the same thing. love and friendship, not God and friendship. although i guess that works too. intellectual people would probably say knowledge is the greatest thing, because without knowledge, we're all just a bunch of mindless humans. some say money, power, recognition...but i know the truth. the greatest thing, the inventor of all things great, is imagination. think about it: when you're bored, you imagine. you imagine in your sleep. imagination creates everything...art, books, technology, architechture, even such things as a three-hole punch. and love...imagination certainly creates that. if you're one of those ""love is true, and nothing but love can create that"" people, deal with it. imagination is amazing. every thought you have is imagination. it's going on in your head all the time. it can make you believe you have friends when you don't, you have a family when you don't. it makes people see things, makes people crazy. when you read the greatest book, your imagination is kicking in, fitting the images in your head. when you watch the greatest movie, your imagination is there, filling in the gaps of the story, comprehending the pasts of the characters. i mean, you can't escape the fact that imagination is the greatest thing ever, over all categories. it's as simple as this: without imagination, the other categories wouldn't exist. hell, you wouldn't exist. sex probably takes an incredible ammount of imagination. and love, as i've already said, is a product of imagination.  i totally won that argument. totally. no doubt in my mind. i mean, unless you've got something better. but i'd be willing to bet you 5 bucks that whatever you come up with isn't nearly as good as imagination, or it's created by imagination. 5 bucks. right here, right now."	f
"1/18/04   One day I don't have homework...The whole world does   Weird. The one day I actually have no homework and can do something EVERYONE else has homework. Not surprising since exams are coming up but why the heck does this happen on a Sunday? Ugh well since that happened my day was pretty much downright boring. Not much to write about today.  Woke up at around 830 for church. Kinda woke up late today so didn't gel hair or anything. THIS is when a good old hat comes in. I can cover up my hair with my hat. Innovative no =P. Went to pick up Jason. Since we didn't do worship, Pastor Mackness got this person called Dave Butler. He came a few times before but I really think that we should be able to do our own worship within our own church. Well today's message....erm.......well I remember the story. It was about David and the Besor River (spelling?) and about how he basically reclaimed stuff from bandits. Hmm this is great I can't remember what the main message was....  Well after a brief talk with Jason....I now remember. Thanks Jason by the way. Well it was kinda about how though we are followers of God, we still make bad choices. However we are forgiven if we believe. I think that was it. Oh boy this isn't good. Well I think that was it. Slow day. With UWO students out on a retreat there weren't many of us. Well after Offering and Benediction no song of respone since Dave had to leave....so we had announcements and went downstairs.  First thing I did was a great thing to do. Took off my hat and lo and behold......my hair isnt turned into hat hair. It's sticking out everywhere. Thanks a lot FlexFit. Damn. So yeah I had a bit of a bad hairday today. Oh yeah and today was VERY messed up. For some reason Brian Wong tried skin moisturizer *WTH IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD NOW?!* and then Josh decided to wear Steph's pink scarf today. I decided to wear a scarf as a Turban and walk around pretending I was Taliban. Yes I realize that that was stupid. No worries though. We chatted around for a bit before Me Gavin and Steph volunteered to help with Children's Sunday School. Originally Rebecca and Josh were gonna help too but Pastor Mackness said 3 was enough. So off me and Gavin and Steph went to help with Children's Sunday School...  HOLY CRAP THIS IS ACTUALLY CHALLENGING! Trying to control 22 kids at once is NOT A FUN THING TO DO. And especially what we were doing today....pelting paper balls at someone while they were trying to find a yellow circle. Lol wish I had the pic from my D-Cam uploaded. This room is actually VERY chaotic. I now realize why I was in a way happy leaving CSS (not the internet lingo but Children's Sunday School). Well after about 20 minutes of pure chaos.....it ended off with a ""calm"" prayer. For some reason all these kids seem to have ADD.I was surprised of how even a 4 year old can be so hyper. Well afterwards it was ""San Wui."" So everyone was done. Service was over lah lah lah and stuff. I decided to go talk to Colin Ho's dad about making a website for our church. While that happened we somehow dragged Joseph Ma into it too and Josh. Well now we are putting a talk of starting a web design group for our church. Hope it's up and running by June or so. I'm apparently doing imaging. Whoo hoo. Now if only I had a more creative mind. Photoshop's actually very user friendly as later I would find out though. While we were waiting for my Dad to finish cleaning up Jason was trying to read his GMR magazine....but miserably failed with Rebecca and everyone else crowding around him remarking about how Doom 3 looks disgusting. I personally liked the looks of this one game coming out. Fatal Frame or somethin. Supposed to be a combination of Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 3. Both those games I am interested in. So this game should be good. GT 4 Graphics are AMAZING I also found out today and Starcraft Ghost....now #1 *over Silent Hill 3* on my most wanted games list. LOOKS SO COOL. And it should keep me entertained until StarCraft Two comes out. If it ever happens. Well after Jason FINALLY got a chance to read since everyone else left, we had to leave....  So he read in the car. Reminds me of the time when Patrick told me he read in the car for 4 hours *who the heck would read the Caesar 3 manual?* and then threw up afterwards. Not surprising. Well anyways less sidetracking. Jason went home. I went home and ate and then from like 3-6 I sat on the comp fiddling with photoshop. I WAS going to go to webstation but had no ride and the buses suck like crap. Eventually I ended up sitting home....Playing the piano, drumming, MSN, watching TV. Superstation is now one of the best channels on TV I have just realized.  Well after watching some TV....I went back on photoshop. Made a splashscreen for a HYPE website when it happens. I took a pic of night sky *really nice pic if i could put it on this site but no server so nope.* and then just did some stuff with it. Well after that I watched GI Jane. Not that great of a movie. Then now I'm sitting here......blogging......talking on msn.......n stuff. Can't really recall anything else happening today. Was gonna go snowboard but didnt'. Well now I'm gonna quickly refresh my mind on Grade 2 theory for a test tomorrow then sleep. Later."	m
"urlLink Bush’s U.N. fiasco   I read the Bush address word for word on-line, and I don't understand where Fred Kaplan is coming from.  I suspect the real issue with the left is that Bush didn't get down on his knees and cry for forgiveness.    We did the right thing in Iraq.  We are still doing the right thing, and the situation is far from the description we get from the media outlets.  A second democrat congressman has wrote a piece similar to the piece I linked the other day.  Gallup released a poll today taken in Iraq that mirrored the Zogby poll of last week.  Iraq is getting better, one step at a time.  As for this idea that the only answer is a UN answer, I simply don't understand.  How can a 'solution' drawn up by a large group that do not share a common interest be better than a focused effort to pacify Iraq?  The coalition one objective, primarily - turn Iraq into a free nation that does not threaten the world.  The UN has little interest in building a free nation.  Look at the membership of the UN!  Over half of the member states do not have representative government.  At least a third are open dictatorships.  How are these people any better than us when it comes to erecting a free government in Iraq?  George Will had the best line - ""The UN Security Council is a World War II victory parade frozen in time.""  It is quickly becoming irrelevant."	m
"La Vida de Drama   Shit sux.  Mom's sick (again).  Evermean thinks she effed up (again)...so not the case.  I'm borderline bipolar...lol.  Lauryn Hill's Unplugged provoked thought that I didn't necessarily wanna face.  Have taken the first step towards making amends with my sister (before I snap her neck).  This will be my last attempt at trying to understand and get along with her.  I called her yesterday to set up a meeting and she was awf da, ""what I do now?!"".  Um..shaddup ponk, just show up mkay?   I love her, but sometimes I wanna kick her in the chin.  She's not a girl, but not yet a woman.  Yall feel me?  Her shit don't stink (apparently), so imma show her somma my shit...damnit.  My other sister (the baby) is going with us to Savannah (again).  Evermean and I scored a video camera...aw lawd..lol.   We plan on videotaping errything.  I don't think I'll post videos online, but pictures definitely.      urlLink Tiffani  asked me how Evermean got her name.  Before I explain that, I must explain our ""house"".  For those of you who don't know, it's the House of Martini.  That's how I got my name.  The HOM is basically a group of friends who ""borrowed"" the Paris is Burning concept of ""houses"".  Yall know how some of the ""boys"" set up houses of fabulousness and basically rename themselves.  That's what we did.  The House of Martini is a group of likeminded chicks who fit the Five B's of Fabulousness (can't share)..lol.  There's Tini, Persia, Magenta, Evermean, and Nona.  We had naming ceremonies to come up with our names.  Tini, Persia and I chose our own names.  Nona comes from Nona Hendrix.  I used to love her as a kid.  I thought she was sexy, dominant, and a cross between a man, woman, and cyborg freak (basically me) and she dressed her ass off and said whatever the hell she wanted.  Magenta and Evermean were our last two members.  Magenta is our ""spiritual guide"" sort of.  She's got supernatural abilities so we decided to give her a gypsy name like Magenta.  As for Evermean.  Well, she's a sweetheart for real, but her pseudo-personality is so funny.  She be awf da redneck, tabacco chewin' shit talkin...lol.. Always asking, ""Who mess wiff you?  Don't make me kick dey ass""..LOL  When I first met her, I thought she was one of the cutest, sweetest women I've ever seen.  Once I got to know her, I realized that though very giving and nice, she'll kick somebody's ass quick..lol  That's so funny to me.  With her little 5 foot 4 self.  She's just basically overprotective of anyone she cares about.  But the way she handles it, is so effin funny.  For instance, last year in Savannah one of our friends turned up missing.  Basically, she ran off drunk with some unknown guy and never returned home.  Once she got back, she and the guy were laid up in the bed drunk.  Evermean was so pissed that our friend had scared the piss outta all of us (cuz we thought she was really missing), she busted in the hotel room, took one look at the dude and said, ""Who the hell are you?!  I don't care who you are, but you got to get the fuck out right now. When I get back, you betta be gone or your ass is mine!"".  All of us nosey girls are lookin at her with our mouths wide open like we can't believe she just threatened to beat this guys ass (who was twice her size and had a friend outside).  She then took our friend in the bathroom and jacked her up so bad that the poor girl was calling the airport to get the hell outta there.  She was crying so hard, she was shaking.  Meanwhile, ol' boy packed his shit and rolled out..LOL.  That shit was so funny.  I'd never seen Evermean so mad.  So Tini and I were watching the Wiz one night and Evilene's sister's name was Evermean.  We thought, PERFECT.  That's her ""house"" name.  She didn't like it at first, but once we explained everything, she was fine with it.        Last year in Savannah, all types of shit broke out.  My sister and another one of our friends beat up a girl and her husband.  I passed out twice in front of a hotel (slobbing on myself wiff no shoes)..lol,  and every last one of us were pissy drunk.  We all came back with lots of beads (works like Mardi Gras).  I sang, All Cried Out by Lisa Lisa at a kareoke bar awf da talking about men aint shit..lol.  We showed tits, butts, kissed old nasty men, humped strangers, all that shit.  I can't wait to post my Savannah blog.  That shit's gonna be funny."	f
I am so fucking tired today.   I know.  I haven't posted in ages.  I don't really have anything of value to say usually.  Today is no different.  The LAN Party was enjoyable, if not a little small.  All seemed to be a little sick from the blipping screens and the influx of junk food, pop and pizza.  However, I feel I emerged victorious as I was able to drive home and not actually crash into anything despite the above noted sickness combined with a tiredness that had to be seen to be believed (I didn't fall asleep when I got home, I passed out, even though I wasn't drinking).  Now I'm at work, too early, but am fortunate that the morning manager is just as tired as me and is willing to schedule nap time prior to the store opening.  Time to catch up on some missed sleep.  Ta ta for.... zzzzzzzzz......	m
"I have so much to say about what happened today.   I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.    This morning, at around 10:00-10:30, Jasmine and I walked over to Kevan's house.  Kevan's mother then dropped us off at Cal's house at 11:00.  Immedietly, Kevan, Jasmine and I ran up to Robin's room and started to clean up the brushes and paint.  Half of the room was already painted so we started from where we left off.  By the time we finished painting the walls light blue, it was already 12:00.  We weren't finished yet.  Jasmine pointed out that there was a can of darker blue paint so we opened it up and painted the door.  The thing thats took the longest was painting each and every little individual crack.  It took atleast a good hour and a half to finish painting the cracks.  The cracks took way longer then expected because we didn't have any paint brushes.  Kevan and I experimented with diffrent ""painting techniques"".  When we rialised that we didn't have any paint brushes, Kevan took a roll of toilette paper, riped off a reasonable sized piece and started painting with it.  It was a good idea until the paper started to rip and leave behind little chunks on the wall.  Next, Jasmine decided to use fabric instead.  The fabric worked way better then the paper but it was hard to get a big enough piece.  Then, I went downstairs and came back upstairs with a couple of sponges.  The sponges worked the best out of all three ideas.  After painting the walls light blue and the door a darker blue, Kevan decided to do this really cool painting design but it was then ruined by Jasmine so they painted the border white.  When the border was finished, I cleaned out the room, swept the floor and we all painted the floor with the darker blue paint.  It looked really good.  By the time we finished painting, it was 2:57.  We then took a half hour break and ate this tasty ""Western Family"" popcorn.  At 3:30, we went upstairs and put in this nice blue rug, set up the bed frame, brought up the two mattresses, the dresser and desk, made the bed and added our final touches too the room so it would look perfect.  Kevan then wrote a note on behalf of all of us, to Robin explaining to her why we did this for her and that we spent two weeks planning this surprise.  When Robin walked into the room, we all yelled ""SURPRISE!"".  She screamed of joy and then started to cry.  She loved it.  Our hard work had payed off.  It took around 5 hours but the room was perfect and it was worth it."	f
I just finished reading a really cool book ... It was lent to me by K.C. (thanks K!).  It is called Seven Daughters and Seven Sons by Barbara Cohen and Bahija Lovejoy.  A story based on a folktale from Iraq.  It is young adult fiction (which is what K collects) but still a worthwhile read!  So, if you haven't read a good book lately, this one is a good one.  It is short (only 220 pages) and should only take you an hour or so to read.  I just wanted to share!  On another note, thank you to everyone for comments on my Driving for Morons series ... I'm thinking about publishing a 3rd blog dedicated solely to these lessons -  let me know what you think, kay!  I am hunting for a new blogskin for my prayer blog ... Found a really nice one and then realized that the author was pirating images, so I'm back to square one.  Wish I was smart enough to write my own (I'm learning, but it's a slllloooowww process) and with blogger, I can't have images cause no where to host.  I think I may have to break down and get my own domain.  Well, I'm off to gather up laundry (laundry day tomorrow, oh fun) and then go to bed.  Hope you are having a good weekend.  (BTW ... Nice to hear from you Sam I Am!  I shall reply soon, promise!)  Night!	f

I'm done with the presentation, and since we went first, I'm done for the quarter. Now I can just be a normal class member. I'm not sure how I felt about our presentation, people said we did good, but I felt a bit lame, and somewhat disappointed. I wish we'd had more group cohesion. I think it could have been better.  Now I'm off to the RMS winter encampment. After I posted earlier about not really wanting to go, Jerm got a bug up his butt and got all excited and enthusiastic about going. He even built a rope bed this week, which I must admit I'm a bit nervous about. Apparently it's an old Byzantine design, and is quite clever. I think Jerm has found his niche in the history world: historical engineering. People have been clever for a long time, and came up with some inventive solutions to design and stuctural problems. But now we're going to sleep in it, so we'll see how well he followed the design!  Thanks for the few emails of those of you who've checked this thing out. At some point I'm going to move this to Jerm's server and add some more features, like a comments section. I'll be gone all weekend, I'll write again on Monday.	f
"The transmission is in the Subaru. The job's not finished for a couple parts that had to be ordered. It was lots of hard work. Son Noah and I worked Saturday and Sunday getting everything back together. I'm sunburnt and cranky and my schoolwork didn't get done.  So that leaves me tonight to research and write a paper and try to get the yard mowed. And I've got to get a part ordered for Lily's car. And do my paying work too. There's lots of that today.  And the boy did something really, really stupid over the weekend that may put the planned trip for his summer break out of the question. You see, Lily was out of town at her grandmother's and he finds Heather, her best friend to hang out with Friday night. Pretty soon after that potentially relationship breaking complications occur. Heather's willing to leave it unsaid with Lily, Noah's taking the ""gotta tell the truth no matter how painful"" tact and so he may be girlfriend-free after Wednesday night when he gets home from Job Corp. Serves him right if that's how it turns out."	m

[16254]   Last night I went to the TASC banquet with Melissa, Becky and Nick. It was alright? I thought the food and performances were better last year. Afterwards, Melissa, Becky and I watched  Clockwork Orange  and played Scrabble. It was cool.  I sort of talked about this before and the topic came up in class Thursday. We read some articles on third wave feminism, and one of them commented the influence of riotgrrl and online zines. Stephanie commented on how that subcultural stuff is simply something that people think is cool, and women don't transition into any sort of real politics from there. I rebutted her comment that, that subculture is something that does lead to the creating of academics and artists with politics. However, she argued that, that means that they're just all bourgeois. I don't really agree with her on that... I'm sure my many of my friends (some of you who read this) would disagree. I mean, come on... there's a big difference between these women than women who listen to misogynistic pop music and let society push 'em around. This goes back to my comments a few days ago in how I can't separate my musical tastes and subcultural roots from my academic work.  A different topic... I think I stumbled back into a trap, that I thought I had got out of. Things that made me angry still really annoy me, but sometimes you get blinded by other things...  ***	m
Computer skills are a must, 'cause in the web we trust   There has been a new study warning against the exposure of children to TV and computers before the age of 2.  Their reasoning seems valid.  This new study shows that exposure to television and videos, especially fast-paced images that are typical of most children's programming, affects the way the brain wires itself. Essentially, it prunes out circuits that don't get used. The more time a child spends in front of a screen, the less he is using circuits responsible for social interaction and deductive reasoning. So those circuits are the ones it eliminates, which somehow is linked with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Now the potential of ADHD should definitely not be taken lightly, but what is the down side of not exposing your child to the various learning activities these media provide?  For single parents or families where both parents work, what is a viable alternative?  I don't know the answer to these questions, but I do know how my son is doing and he is almost 2 years old.  My wife and I started him on the computer probably at about 6 or 8 months old.  The Disney toddler set with Mickey Mouse and Winnie The Pooh CDs was our first purchase.  We quickly learned that the keyboard was a distraction, so we removed that and helped him learn the mouse.  What was so great about these CDs--especially the Mickey Mouse one--was that the activities provided positive feedback when the pointer was simply moved across the intended object (no clicking necessary).  So he quickly mastered that and we graduated to the Disney pre-school CD set, which does require clicking.  Tip: do something to draw your child's attention to the left mouse button, otherwise he/she won't differentiate the two and it may lead to frustration.  Anyway, my son went on to master clicking and dragging.  Before we went to the pre-school versions, he knew all the letters of the alphabet, numbers from 1 to 10 and most primary colors.  Now he knows numbers from 1 to 20, uses adjectives like big, small, little, fast, broken, etc. and attempts to sing songs.  That takes me to the TV side of the discussion.  He's been watching The Disney Channel and Noggin for as long as I can remember.  I believe their interactive activities have also helped him develop his counting and alphabet.  Of course, we don't just sit him in front of the computer or TV and that's that.  We actively participate in these things as well as providing supplemental instruction using a chalkboard, Etch-A-Sketch, crayons  paper, books, anything we can do to keep learning interesting for him.  Now, does he always want to answer the quiz questions?  Of course not.  Sometimes he cooperates, sometimes not.  But he does know his stuff and when he has gone to a new environment that happens to have letters, numbers or colors displayed, people have been amazed at the way he rattles them off.  Raising our son--and now our daughter who is almost a year old--is our number one priority, but it is tuff because I work days and my wife works nights.  I certainly hope that all the exposure they've had to the computer and TV does not have a detrimental long term affect.  Up until I first heard about this study, I believed the results of the early exposure to be all positive.  Now every time we get half way through the alphabet and my son goes on to do something else I worry whether this is an early sign of ADHD.  They've made me paranoid and not really posed any realistic alternatives for daily learning at an early age for the average family who is on the go for most of each day.  Thanks guys.  Anyway, just to bring you back to the subject of this Blog, the early computer skills my son has learned will go a long way toward his unlimited exploitation of the internet.  And I have an even more personal example of the power of the computer/internet.  I grew up familiar with PCs and the Internet and went to The George Washington University, my brother (who is 7 years younger) grew up with a PC (in high school) and went to Harvard.  He had his first website before I even knew their was a language called HTML.   urlLink SerialThriller.com	m

"I know why heaven and hell are so believable... it's a simple question. Well, here it is.  Someone from  physicsforums.com  made a pretty good point. This person said that he was speaking with a friend who recently had a close relative die. He was attempting to make her feel better, but didn't know how. However, he then thought of a myth he had heard: heaven and hell.  He proceeded to tell his hurt friend that her relative was now in heaven.  Now what can we see from this story? Well, for one, heaven and hell are used as comforts.  (You're probably saying to yourself that hell is not a comfort. I can explain this in one word:  justice . Go tell a Jew that Hitler is burning in hell and you'll see what I mean.)  Well, what I'm trying to say is that this myth of ""comfort"" caught on and transformed through  the years. It's easy... and you can't disprove it, which makes it even better. Awesome, huh?  It also provides a sense of hope that you don't completely die and your body continues to exist even after death. After all, if you eventually die on Earth, what is our purpose here? Well, there probably is no purpose except to provide progress of civilization... but what does civilization matter if the universe eventually ends.  Therefore, heaven and hell were created (in man's imaginations) for two main reasons: comfort (hope and justics) and purpose of life.  Q.E.D."	m
I want to thank Ian, for wishing me a happy birthday today. As I was talking to him on the phone, he gave me the best present ever. I hope he does not get mad at me for telling everyone what he did for me. It is a long story but, when Ian and I used to date a couple of years ago. The first song that we kissed to was an odd one; the song was called  Push Me, Pull Me  by  Pearl Jam.  As we were talking on the phone I started to hear a song in the background on Ian's end of the line. I asked him what was happening over there and the song got louder and he wished me a happy birthday. I never thought you would remember that, thank you Ian.    Ian thought I was getting sad again, because I was crying a lot. But, it was because was very romantic andI was just sohappy. So Ian doesn't have to worry. After I finished speaking with Ian, Adam also gave me a nice birthday cake and gave me a present. WhenI opened it up I found a copy of Harvest Moon, for Super Nintendo. I have been looking for a copy of this game forever and now I have it. I think this is one of my best birthdays I have ever had.    Thank you Ian and Adam.	f

"What do you trust in? Yourself? Your lover? Your God? Your country? More importantly, why do you trust in the things that you do?  I think trust is a matter of personal history. If you grew up in an environment where you felt safe and loved and things were stable, you will tend to be a more trusting person as an adult. You will be able to weather storms naturally that others who did not grow up in such an environment may not be able to weather as well.   On the other hand, if you grew up in an environment where you could not trust your parents to be there for you, where you were abandoned emotionally or physically, where your needs were not met or where you were abused you will have a harder time trusting anyone or anything as an adult. But that doesn't mean that you can't overcome this past history. We can all re-learn trust in our adult lives and leave the past where it belongs, in the dust behind our footsteps into the future.  I grew up in one of those environments where nothing was certain and I couldn't trust the adults in my life. They frequently told me things that I knew were not true or lied by omission. Some of them abused me physically, some emotionally, some both. There were even peers who did the same. Lied to me, pretended to be a friend and then raped me, told me they would be there for me and then caved to other pressures that took them away.   This pattern continued for me through college and my first marriage. It was not until I was in my late 20's that I found people I could trust not to lie to me or hurt me. And, of course, I was suspicious; always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Please don't think that I am telling you that every little betrayal of trust we suffer when young results in trust issues as adults. Everyone suffers small betrayals and lies and hurt as they grow and mature. I am talking about major hurts, abuse and neglect  that causes damage to the psyche of the individual that is not so easily forgotten or healed.  So what does one do in this situation? Never trust anyone again as long as they live? Hardly. There is no way we, as social creatures, can live that way. But how to make that leap to trust that seems to elude the broken and battered among us? What is the key? Where is the magic word that will allow us to trust again? How can we know for certain that this time is going to be different and we are going to be okay and not get hurt?  The bottom line is that there is no magic here. There is not trick and there are no guarantees. We simply have to live in some very uncomfortable places and ""pretend"" to have trust until the real thing develops. Yep, that's right, pretend that we trust. Act like we trust. Do all the things that bespeak a deep and natural trust of a person a situation or a relationship.  The funny thing about pretending is that it tends to become real after awhile. Suffer through the uncomfortable time of pretending and, in time, the person or relationship you have pretended to have trust in either betrays that trust or builds it for you. In other words, it's not our job to build trust, it is our job to accept it and then believe in it. The burden of building trust is upon those who live with us and love us.   Is it unfair to ask another person to shoulder the burden of our past and be the one who has to pull us out of the quagmire of our own hurt and distrust? I don't think so. If the person really values us and wants that trust they will be patient (to a point...no matter how much someone loves you, they can only take so much) and allow us to pretend while they act with truth and grace. And as we pretend, we build trust each day that is real.   It's like a plunge into a cold lake on a hot day this leap into the unknown world of trusting those around us and the relationships therein. It is very, very scary for us. That gibbering voice in the back of our minds tells us constantly that we are going to be hurt or even destroyed if our trust is misplaced and the person betrays us. But that voice is not rational. It is a voice from our past. It is the voice of fear and history that we need to silence to move on with our lives.  Will we get hurt? Yes. Will people disappoint us? Yep, you bet. Will we live through it? Uh huh. Just like we have before and we'll come out stronger on the other side no matter the result of the trust we place. If it turns out to be rewarded with love and fidelity and goodness then we come out stronger and more trusting of others and ourselves. If we get hurt and our trust is once more abused we come out the other side wiser and stronger and ready to try again because, quite honestly, we have no other choice if we are to live life fully and openly and even have a shot at all the joy we would otherwise miss if we were to live constantly in distrust."	f

"Alright, so I don't do happy all the time. I don't smile all the time, and really, I don't think about smiling or frowning all that much. It doesn't mean I'm depressed, last I checked, yeah I have problems that I need to work out - being jobless, ""living"" in Sacramento after moving from San Francisco. I did the move for school purposes, and I need to deal with that, and I'm perfectly capable of doing so. I'm not frowning because I'm here - only when I come back after having visited a real city, and remembering how much I left behind, but then I remember that I left it behind to better myself. This thought doesn't make me estatic by any streatch of the imagination, but I'm hardly reaching for the razor blade.  Things could be better, but they could be worse - its an emotional void actually, I'm not numb, I just can't be bothered by extremes right now as they drain my energy, which I need to focus on getting the hell out of Dodge.  I have been reminded by friends that I am far too guarded. My first thoughts (yes all at once) are: Fuck you, they're right, there's nothing I can do that I'm comfortable doing. There are those that find comfort in the bottle, those that find comfort in pills or needles, and those that find comfort in the smoke. I do fit in the bottle group, my guard does drop, and I'm more sociable. I do't want to find comfort in any of those things, which is why I  rarely  drink, and I have done both ""E"" and the leaf, but have no need or desire to do them again. I want to find my comfort on my own, with my own strength, see what I can do - and work off that.  Some of the other sisters have indulged in the leaf and bottle, and being the sober one, I see that there is no strength in these activities. I've witnessed their strength without the substances. They believe there is strength - or some shamanistic wisdom in imbibing while doing public service. Do they (the ones that do indulge) do a good job with blessings while high - honestly, yes they do. The ones that don't indulge - do a good job as well. Is it fair for me to judge? I think it is, especially because I know what these people are capable of on their own - they seem to believe they need a crutch - or an idol to say ""this helped."" This is my opinion of what I see.  What does this have to do with my superficial happiness or lack thereof? I want it all to be real, natural - it means more (to me, the one feeling the emotions). I won't stop myself from happiness or sadness as doing so is (in my opinion) unhealthy. Just because I'm not smiling, does not mean I'm not happy - and anyone who's worked reatil can tell you that is really easy to think ""I hate you, you foul cheap bastard"" while smiling."	m

"You may or may not have noticed the ""Iraq Body Count"" banner in the sidebar of the blog.  Here's some background info on it.  The IRAQ BODY COUNT Project  This is a human security project to establish an independent and comprehensive public database of media-reported civilian deaths in Iraq resulting directly from military action by the USA and its allies in 2003. In the current occupation phase this database includes all deaths which the Occupying Authority has a binding responsibility to prevent under the Geneva Conventions and Hague Regulations. This includes civilian deaths resulting from the breakdown in law and order, and deaths due to inadequate health care or sanitation. Results and totals are continually updated and made immediately available on this page and on various IBC counters which may be freely displayed on any website, where they will be automatically updated without further intervention. Casualty figures are derived solely from a comprehensive survey of online media reports. Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum and a maximum) are given. All results are independently reviewed and error-checked by at least three members of the Iraq Body Count project team before publication.  The project takes as its starting point and builds upon the earlier work of Professor Marc Herold who has produced the most comprehensive tabulation of civilian deaths in the war on Afghanistan from October 2001 to the present, and the methodology has been designed in close consultation with him.  Professor Herold commented: “I strongly support this initiative. The counting of civilian dead looms ever more importantly for at least two reasons: military sources and their corporate mainstream media backers seek to portray the advent of precision guided weaponry as inflicting at most, minor, incidental civilian casualties when, in truth, such is is not the case; and the major source of opposition to these modern ‘wars’ remains an informed, articulate general public which retains a commitment to the international humanitarian covenants of war at a time when most organized bodies and so-called ‘experts’ have walked away from them”.   Rationale:  Adversities such as wars and civil wars threaten the survival and dignity of millions of people. The victims of these conflicts are primarily, if not almost exclusively, civilians - ordinary men and women. Civilian casualties are the most unacceptable consequence of all wars. Each civilian death is a tragedy and should never be regarded as the “cost” of achieving our countries’ war aims, because it is not we who are paying this price. One in four killed in the US war on Afghanistan were civilians, and in Yugoslavia the proportion was even higher. We believe it is a moral and humanitarian duty for each such death to be recorded, publicised, given the weight it deserves and, where possible, investigated to establish whether there are grounds for criminal proceedings.  Traditionally, security threats were examined in the context of ""state security"", i.e. the protection of the state, its boundaries, people, institutions and values from external attacks. States set up powerful military systems to defend themselves. People were considered to be assured of their security through the protection extended by the state. Recent history, however, shows that the states as ""protector of people"" frequently come to play ineffective if not adversarial roles. They showed no serious interest in documenting and investigating the civilian deaths and their causes. The governments of victor states certainly have almost no interest in doing this during the conduct of military campaigns. Proponents of “modern” warfare also make much of the claim that their weapons are “smart” or “precision guided.” Civilian deaths give the lie to such claims. Recent examples demonstrate that no air-launched weapon can avoid civilian deaths.  The UN Secretary-General has called the world community to advance a new human-centred approach to these problems. As a contribution to this effort, the Commission on Human Security (CHS) first met in New York in June 2001 and held its second meeting in Tokyo in December 2001. The Iraq Body Count project is a direct response to this agenda of Human Security.   The Iraq Body Count project aims to promote public understanding, engagement and support for the human dimension in wars by providing a reliable and up-to-date documentation of civilian casualties in the event of a US-led war in 2003 in the country. The duty of ‘recorder’ falls particularly heavily on the ordinary citizens of those states whose military forces cause the deaths. In the current crisis, this responsibility must be borne predominantly by citizens of the USA and the UK.  It is accepted that war causes many dire consequences for the civilian population even if they are not directly killed or injured in military strikes. They may suffer long-term injury or illness (as a result, for instance of radiation, post-conflict contact with unexploded munitions, pollution due to spillage of toxic materials). UN estimates suggest that a war in Iraq would create starvation and homelessness for millions. A widely-leaked UN report on the humanitarian consequences of a US-led war in Iraq has estimated that the conflict would create two million refugees. (BBC News, 28 January, 2003, 07:38 GMT) People may suffer deep psychological trauma, miscarriage, bereavement, dislocation, and loss of home and property. Destruction of civil infrastructure can have effects which last for generations. These factors undoubtedly cause many further deaths. However, documenting and assigning responsibility for such effects requires long-term “on the ground” resources. Immediate deaths and injuries through military strikes can be pinpointed in place and time, and responsibility straightforwardly attributed to the weapon that caused the death or injury.  This project aims to record single-mindedly and on a virtually real-time basis one key and immutable index of the fruits of war: the death toll of innocents. The full extent of this has often gone unnoticed until long after a war has ended, if at all. One reason is that reports of incidents where civilians have been killed are scattered in different news sources and spread over time: one or two killed here, a few dozen there, with only major incidents (such as the attack on the Al-Amariyah bomb shelter where hundreds of women, children and elderly were incinerated alive) being guaranteed headline coverage. But the smaller numbers quickly add up: and however many civilians are killed in the onslaught on Iraq, their death toll should not go unnoticed by those who are paying — in taxes — for their slaughter. It is to these all too easily disregarded victims of violence that Iraq Body Count is dedicated, and we are resolute that they, too, shall have their memorials.  Methodology:  1. Overview  Casualty figures are derived from a comprehensive survey of online media reports and eyewitness accounts. Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum and a maximum) are given. All results are independently reviewed and error-checked by at least two members of the Iraq Body Count project team in addition to the original compiler before publication.  2.

"and when it isn't it is called perversion? =] Just a little observation to explain that to each their own and definition of where to draw the line is relative to who is involved and the whims of the time.  I have been involved in BDSM for several years now as well as 3 separate 3sms and I can honestly say that while some things are different much remains the same. We are human beings as ever and much is static in our behaviour. We deal with the same jealousies and feelings of inadequacy and fears no matter if someone is holding a whip over our backs or serving us a TV dinner while we watch Archie Bunker.  One thing that people don't think about when they fantasize about 3sms is that we are not dealing with fuck faces pasted on the air of our minds while we jack n jill. We deal with multi-faceted human beings with moods and ideas in a changing fickle world. If you think one relationship spins your head and stirs up your world ... just imagine how a relationship with 3 people would take a blender to it. In a 2 party relationship you deal with at least 5 relationships. You have the relationship as a whole, you have the way 1 person deals with the other and the way the other person deals with the first and then you have the way 1 person deals with the relationship as a whole and the way the other person deals with it as a whole............ in a 3sm you have at least 13 different relationships! 13!  I know what most people would say... I said it at one time myself.... ""But I am not in this for relationships, just the sex and fun!"" It is NEVER just sex and fun EVEN if you and your partner skip around to not having sex with the same person more than twice. It changes things in your relationship forEVER! Especially if, as a man, you just want to sleep with more than one female. Because sooner of later she is going to think of some other guy and BANG! Your dick is in an uproar and I don't mean with a pleasant stiffy! (This applies to women too!) There is no way around this.... adding another person (even if an amalgamation of many people and you and your partner) is going to change the way you look at each other and feel about each other.  As to why BDSM is appealing to people. This is as diverse an answer as to why people like a certain song or band.  First off let me explain my role. I am a switch... meaning I like to be a top as well as a bottom. I like being a top because I naturally have a domineering personality and being able to manipulate people to feel a certain way (whether by their request or my whim) turns me on. It is why I am an artist. It is why I write stories and poetry. I like to be able to make people react from a gut level before they have time to think about the correct response. And since I am a switch I get a kick knowing that I am the cause of someone feeling that feeling I get when I am a bottom.  Why I am a bottom..... First let me clarify something. I do not ""like"" pain. I do not orgasm when I walk barefoot down the street and stub my toe or step on glass. I do however like the endorphins released by the shock of such an event when it is by choice. Much of my life and thinking is contained in a self monitored package with all the checks and controls necessary to existing in every day society. All the while I still having this brain that composes art in peoples faces while walking down the street in that instance before eye contact is made and self preservation kicks in. And it screams when contained too tightly! But it has learned one thing..... The controlled side screams too.... and the controlled side, for all its strength and carefully finished exterior, shatters when it gets too exhausted, by whatever method ... be it pain or stress or overwork. If you cause it unpleasantness for long enough it will release and the doves will weep for joy in their cages shuttering with that pre-anticipation of unfettered flight. The innocence of lambs will frolic unknowingly in the bliss before their inevitable slaughter, completely unaware so therefore free. And I get that feeling you get after a REALLY good orgasm (the one better than the feeling you get right after a MUCH needed piss!) And through its extremes it has much the same anaesthetic effect of walking on sharp rocks with a toothache.... Bliss is found through much needed release caused by the extreme distraction the pain provides. You reach this point (by the same building process much like an orgasm) where everything else in the world is reduced to the point right in front of your eyes. And in a society where we are bombarded second by second with the colors and choices of mass advertising, millions of different songs to listen to, and sights to see...... this is an extremely profound place! There is NOTHING but you at your most real. You have been stripped naked and dropped right back into the womb. The you that you were before society got its hooks and claws into you.  Anyway ... I could go on and on but it would only be a redundant attempt to explain Nirvana through Backstreet Boys videos. It is something you have to experience. Meditation through flogging. It is said that monks and priests do it to get closer to god... and Buddhists starve themselves in fasting and sitting in dark rooms with only incense and a straw mat for comfort..... It is a place you arrive .... not a place you can go....."	f

Oh, and for all of those who ask, 'surely you can go back again and sleep it off?' the answer is yes, but then I wouldn't have time to put in the practice, so I would have to go back again to do that, savvy?	m

A has been very supportive while I have been limping around.  I love him and really appreciate everything he has done for me this weekend.  And I made myself re-read previous posts and am on my guard.  Can't help that.  I just can't work out what he wants and why he wants it.  No words with/from J.  Which I guess means that I won't be getting my John Butler Trio cd's.  Such is life.  Haven't returned C's email.   None of this is BECAUSE of A but because I have been laying low.  Pain will do that.  I'm not sure, but I think A might still want to see other people.  But he says he doesn't want me to, so of course he won't let himself.  But really, I'd be ok with him seeing other people, eventually.  Not necessarily because I want to see other people,  but because I want him to do/be what makes him happy.  Moving forwards, not backward.  Or sideways. Or should I say, limping.	f

"i finally checked out the chapel's sunday service.  it's pretty cool... i may make some more visits.  bettman need to go... they need to review their review policies in the nhl.   urlLink this  is getting ridiculous.   Know goal? The NHL apparently doesn't  By BUCKY GLEASON   6/6/2004      C ALGARY - Hey, Calgary, we in Buffalo feel your pain. We, too, are familiar with phantom goals, or in your case, one that should have counted but never did and wasn't adequately reviewed. Now, it's off to Game Seven with the league getting saddled with yet another controversy in the Stanley Cup finals.  We need not rehash Brett Hull's foot in the crease in the 1999 finals that handed the Stanley Cup to the Dallas Stars. At least that one was open to debate, a judgment call that didn't go the Sabres' way. And of course there was the six-hole in Philly in 2000.   This one could turn out to be a bigger mess because Oleg Saprykin should have been awarded a goal that would have handed the Stanley Cup to the Calgary Flames, rather than forcing them and the Tampa Bay Lightning to travel across the continent and settle things Monday.   History will claim Martin St. Louis' goal 33 seconds into the second overtime gave the Lightning a 3-2 victory in Game Six on Saturday night in the Pengrowth Saddledome, forcing a seventh game in the St. Pete Times Forum on Monday. Calgary should have won the game much sooner, setting up the biggest celebration since the Flames won the Cup in 1989.   ABC replays showed Saprykin scored with just less than seven minutes remaining in regulation after charging past two defensemen and sending a shot into the crease. Nikolai Khabibulin tried kicking it away, but the puck squirted under him and crossed the goal line. Of course, it wasn't reviewed. The Flames became another victim in a league known for making serial mistakes at the worst times.   And they wonder why people say this league is a joke.   Fans were chanting, ""We want the Cup!"" in both overtimes.   Folks, you should have had the Cup. How would you like to be Rhett Warrener, the former Sabres defenseman who was twice a victim. He said going into the series that No Goal was still wrenching his stomach. Now he gets more acid.   The good news was Calgary has another chance, even thought it shouldn't need one. There are few things better in sports than Game Seven, especially in hockey. You think these two teams have been going at each other now? Wait until Monday night. And make sure you're rested. Overtime is expected, if not encouraged.   The Lightning were lucky. They thought they had things under control when Brad Richards scored on the power play from behind the goal line. Everybody knows what happens when Richards scores. The Lightning wins. They're 30-0-2 this season, 8-0 in the playoffs, when he finds the back of the net. And he did it twice.   Apparently, the Lightning win when Saprykin scores, too.   The Lightning's confidence skyrocketed through the saddle-shaped roof when Richards again on the PP later in the period. Certainly, given the previous statistics, the series was certainly headed back to Tampa with the winner hoisting the Cup, no? Well, it doesn't happen quite so easily against the Flames.   They never, and I mean never, give up.   The Flames have been down several times throughout the series, and they were trailing twice Saturday night, but they tied the game both times to set up a nail-biting, heart-pumping third period and 20 minutes, 33 seconds of overtime.   Chris Clark popped one in from the doorstep after Ville Nieminen's blind, spinning feed bounced off Stephane Yelle's stick and landed on Clark's. Marcus Nilson's was even easier after Saprykin weaved through two defenseman and handed Nilson a gimme.   Monday will be a fitting, if not necessary, ending.   It has been a fantastic series, and Game Six was better than Game Five, which was better than Game Four. The hockey gods figured the league will be shutting down next season, so why not extend this one? It's seems the only way to decide a series in which two teams couldn't be better matched if the league called Dial-A-Date.   The best-of-seven series for Lord Stanley's trophy was billed as a battle between Tampa Bay's speed and skill and Calgary's rough and tumble, pretty against punishing. What we've learned over the six games is that the Lightning's toughness was underrated, and so was the Flames' talent. Together, they treated fans to the best series in years.   Now it comes down to one game.   Yes, we get more.   The finals aren't usually a test of hockey so much as a test of survival. Look down the list of Cup winners over the years, and you'll see one team overpowering another, a string of four straight sweeps in the '90s, a necklace of anticlimactic finishes. This year, we watched two teams push each other to exhaustion and beg for more.   The series already had everything. Great goals. Big hits. Breakaways. Cheap shots. Overtime. A suspension. It had a fight between two of the game's best players in Jarome Iginla and Vincent Lecavalier. It had a match of wits between two porky coaches, Calgary's Darryl Sutter and Tortorella. It had short-handed goals and incredible defense, odd-man rushes and unbelievable goaltending.   Iginla and Martin St. Louis, two finalists for the Hart Trophy given to the most valuable player in the regular season, went head-to-head with the same level of play. Iginla positioned himself for the Conn Smythe Trophy by dominating in Calgary's first three victories. St. Louis countered with a goal in Game One, scored a big goal in a victory in Game Two and tied Game Five with another.   The Flames and Bolts crammed more into six games than some teams do into 60. Now it's 82 games and four rounds of the playoffs crammed into one.   And another major blunder threatening to corrupt the finals."	m
"Well, it is later in the evening on my first day in a school.  What a day!  I have already written about the death of one of most popular teachers at CLP this morning.  That was a very unsettling event.  Brings home the idea that one minute you are and the next minute, you aren't.  Makes me want to savor each PP moment, if I can.  I got to CLP at 7:45 a.m.  Guy Jewett, my coordinating teacher, usually arrives fashionably late and with style, so I spent the first 45 minutes or so meeting teachers, listening in on conversations and getting a quick tour.  Jay and I both received the short trip to our rooms, guided by the new CLP principal, Brian Williams, who was very accomodating and welcoming.  I met Cheryl and Eric, Jay's co-op teachers, as well as Megan, a Project Promise 13 graduate.  I was made to feel very welcome, which I appreciated.  At 8:15 a.m., Brian brought out the breakfast burritos and fruit and juice for all.  I had already eaten.  Brian then started the video of the new Superintendent.  We listened to that (sort of.)  We then had an introductory staff meeting and began to cover some agenda and theme issues for the coming year.  We discussed the new study hall, implemented each day for 1/2 hour at the end of the school day.  Also talked about bullying, grades and attendance.  Consistency of implementation of policy was a common theme.  We reviewed the ""6 traits,"" ongoing writing goals to be addressed in each class.  We also talked about Discovery and AVID.  These appear to be behavior management techniques, but I am not too sure about these yet.    We wrapped up talking about some scheduling issues.  Guy arrived at 8:30 a.m., to the catcalls of other teachers.  He is, apparently, well-liked and is used to taking and giving out grief.  Guy is a Computer teacher, but used to be a Social Studies and History teacher.  He appears to be one of the ""go-to"" guys regarding ""Gradebook,"" the computerized grade and attendance tracker that each teacher uses to track the progress of their students.  He was giving a little inservice to the me and the other new teachers about the program when we received the announcement regarding Mr. Bird's death.  That shocked and stunned everyone and the staff quickly lost their focus and determination to get on with the school year.  Guy sent me off to have lunch while he collected his feelings and thoughts.  I ate lunch in Cheryl's room with Cheryl and Jay.  It was great having someone welcome us in during such an unsettling time.   After lunch, I met again with Guy in the North Fork Computer Lab, our classroom.  We went over his class schedule and some of the courses that we will be teaching.  I got to see some of the work from last year's students and the presentations were excellent!  Powerpoint presentations with music, animation, video, etc. all done by 7th graders!  CLP is one of the flagship schools in Poudre School District with respect to Technology.  They were, in fact, the pilot school for the implementation of the Gradebook program, now used in all schools.  Guy has a great approach to his subject and seems to thrive on encouraging students to try and to experiment and to learn on their own.  He provides the tools and some instruction, the kids take it from there.  I think that it will be a *very* exciting experience for me.  Guy also appears very willing to let me teach or participate however I wish.  I am sure he would let me start teaching right away, if I wanted.  I would like to do some observation and help out a little before I dive in, but I am not as worried about teaching his classes as I might have been otherwise.  One other thing about Guy is that he is the Football, track and wrestling coach.  He has alot of respect from the students, particularly athletes.  Add that the fact that he teaches elective classes and I do not foresee classroom management as being much of a problem.  He indicated that there was a ""Personal Economics"" class taught at CLP and that he would be willing to try to hook me up with that teacher, so that I can get some ""business teaching"" experiences in, as well.  We wrapped up the day by setting me up on the computer with a staff login and password.  We also got me a key.  Makes me feel like I belong there.  Guy was off to conduct football practice at 2:00 p.m.  I offered to help in any way that I could, but he declined.  I don't think he wants a ""student coach.""  Wow!  What a first day.  We start again tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m.  I hope that the PP cohort members without student teaching assignments got some today.  This is cool stuff and I hope that everyone is getting a chance to be a part of this like I am."	m

Hello. My name is David Antone, I live in the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village, Ohio and I am currently 17 years old. I attend Bay High School and will be a senior this fall. I recently decided to dedicate myself, for the next ninety days to helping elect Democratic Nominees John Kerry and John Edwards as President and Vice President of the United States and Eric Fingerhut as Ohio U.S. Senator. I have started this blog as an internet base for the Young Democrats Club that I plan to start with some of my friends at my school. I will be posting various articles and information pertaining to the election and the shameful and dangerous monstrosity that is the Bush administration. I will also post info on various volunteer opportunities around the Cleveland area to help register and educate voters, attend rallies or protests, etc. This may be the most important election in our lives. We all must unite, and practice our civic duty of voting to elect John Kerry to prevent another 4 years of the neo-conservative, special interest tailoring, and arrogant Bush administration.

My first exam is next friday, its on Maths Mechanics. ITS SOLID! I don't get hardly any of it, and will most probably get a D or E in it. Going to have to revise loads for it.  I recently got broadband (yeah yeah, I finally got it :D), but the damn thing won't work. The modem keeps flashing saying its waiting for a ADSL Signal, even hoguh the connection has been enabled by BT. My cousin is coming over tonight so hopefully he can sort it out for me, if not, he shall be having words with my ISP. (He's good at scaring people on telephones! lol)  This morning, I woke up at around 10am, and I went for a jog! I have been trying to get into an exercise regime for a while (around 6 months), but today it begun. I went for a little 15 minute jog, woohoo, but I was well tired after it, my heart was beating like a rapid drum.  From tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and do 30 press ups, 50 sit ups, then the jog, come back in and do 20 press ups, and 20 sit ups. I will do this EVERY morning for atleast the next 2-3 weeks. I can honestly say I'm not looking forward to it.  I'mabout to do some research for my Design Technology exam, and then I shall watch Eastenders! I can't stand Andy on it - he's worse than me! Glad to hear Janine is going down for a year, and EURGH, when will Vicky finally disappear?  Currently listening to: Michael Jackson - Stranger in Moscow.	m
"urlLink     BOOOOORRRRRRING!

The dinner ends really late. The last time I went for a wedding dinner I was busy SMS Shell at Fullerton. Flashes of what I always wanted to do during our wedding pops in. If she were to plan together with me, I think ours will be better then tonight, going by what I have in mind. Well... she's not around liao lah.  Too many weddings at Marina till I know how it is like. SUPER boring place, will NEVER hold my wedding there. I actually miss those times when we were going around collecting the wedding packages to compare... looking for a good place for our wedding. The only other stuff taht we din do was to try out the food at those restaurants... would want to do that again... The table makes up of interesting pple... all the couples plus 4 single guys. The 4 of us just kept talking about cars, proposing techniques and others lame stuff. Sigh... phone is not ringing the whole day again.  Coughing blood again just now. Cant breathe well, suffering throughout the wedding. There is just no air...  Should I take MC tml? Dun like being alone at home... haha... go to office and slack again. Very very tired now... just cant sleep, keep waking with flash back again. wonder if the number that I dreamt of last night will come out in 4D.  Sleep.... just need sleep...	m
"wow...a whole hour without an eye twitch!  A miracle!!!  I swear it's from work...I don't know why...perhaps it is my peers bugging me to help make a quilt for the devil's baby...and being the only one with balls and integrity to say no.  I mean, I hate hypocrites...and wouldn't I be one if I did this?  I think so!  But, my posse has a good idea, tell them I've changed my mind and make one...with a BIG BLACK SHEEP!  HA!  Oh, I had it out with bf...well, if you could call it that.  I called her when I got home.  She was in the car with her hubby and kids, so I politely asked if now was a good time.  Well, we sat in silence until she asked why I was mad.  I told her I didn't understand her point to calling and bitching at me at work.  SHe flipped saying ""I was so kidding!"" I said, well, you said you were partly serious.  To which she went off about how I never call anymore, blah, blah blah.  I said it was hard to call and talk to someone who had no interest in what was going on with me and didn't have time to listen, just wanted to talk about what was going on with her.  She was offended, didn't expect her not to be.  She wanted me to explain my statements...so I recounted the million times I called and she would unleash her life story then turn around and say she had to go if I tried to talk.  She denies...big surprise.  So, I told her, you don't have a clue what is going on with my life, you don't ask, you aren't there when I try to talk...she thought I meant literally, so she told me to leave messages (umm, you don't have a machine!)...why must I deal with morons?!    Basically, it boils down to...she doesn't think I ever tried to talk, she isn't here so I can't expect her to be, and she needs me to blatantly ask for support...few issues, a)her hubby was in the background telling her what to say...you know what, dude? YOu don't have a clue what I'M saying so shut the fuck up...b)no shit you aren't here, I am not asking you to physically be here, and if you don't get that, well why are we having this discussion?!, c)halariously ironic...the next day, I got a cosmo girl magazine (don't ask!) and they had this article/blurb about friends...something to the effect, true friends are there for each other without being asked...okay, if teenagers get that, how did you lose that vital piece of 411!  To top it off, at the end of that, to which I just said, you obviously don't get where I am coming from, and I'm tired of talking about it...she asked, so what's been going on?  I laughed so hard I about wet myself...are you kidding me?!  I just told you, I don't tell you shit anymore because you aren't there...I have other people in my life who provide me with that...and yes, that means I am questioning why you are in my life, because, so far, all you do is use and steal... but I just found this funny...so, will I call her?  Why?  I don't call the people I do love and need...those who are there to support.  So before I call her lame ass, I think I will put back to those who have given to me...not stolen (sorry, I had to add that in there!)  Well, it was the day of sisters yesterday...big sis called...my bil is going to be a pastor!  Halarious!  I just find it so ironic...I don't know why, because, to those HCA jacks I wouldn't have been good enough to be related to a pastor!  Well, booyah!  Then, little sis called...she is in a black hole...and I feel really bad for her, not in a pity way, but because I really can identify with her situation...she misses her friends and wants to come home...I don't think I really helped, I tried to lead her through the logical reasons why she should NOT come...when you're emotional, you want to kill people like me...but, she has just seemed so happy...and who wouldn't be?  She got away, she is on the road to success.  I'm so skeptical of friends...so I don't think anyone should relocate just for friends.  I know the friends that I have are my friends no matter where I live and offer that support... I don't really know what to say to her, I just don't think what I said should have been it.  I hope she gets past the initial hurt and takes a step back to analyze.  Kzoo is not right for right now...and friends that would pressure you to change your life for them, aren't real friends.  Friends are supposed to support 110%...unless life threatening, or illegal (sometimes)!  So, not the type of friends I would relocate for.  But there lies a major difference between sis and I...at the end of the day, I truly don't give much of a rip what people think of me or what I do, she does.  Of course, I'm nuts anyway, so take my opinion with a grain of salt!"	f
"As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43.  Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment.  On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go.  Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort.  The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated.  Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the ""intellectuals""; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged.  Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion.  Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous.  There should never be a scenario where one must choose between ""argue"" and ""dispute.""  They're the same thing!!!  In history, the Fed either ""raised interest rates"" or ""discouraged borrowing.""  All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!!  Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests.  For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com.  Find the AP section, and we're taking AP Lang, not Lit, so be wary.  Once again, good luck on the test!  Love, Rob"	f

"urlLink COLLATERAL / ***1/2 (R)   I've always liked Michael Mann products, most notably the movie ""Heat"" with DeNiro and Pacino (and if memory serves, this is the only movie where they appear on screen at the same time).  Mann has some talent, and Miami Vice was no accident.  I'm looking forward to this one.  Cruise has been making very good choices as of late - Last Samuri, Minority Report, the very good Vanilla Sky, and quirky Magnolia, and the under rated Eyes Wide Shut.  I might pay full price for this one."	m
So I hardly ever post anymore, I should do that.  It's probably cuz I have nothing to say.  I've been swamped with things to do and this summer is just not gonna be long enough for all the shit I have to do.   SO THIS IS FOR EVERYONE ON THE BLOG : I'm sorry for making myself distant.  I'm sorry for blaming you all for my problems.  You are all really great people and I'm sorry that I never really let you know that.  I just hate that this feeling that I don't belong anymore.  No matter what you are my best friends in the world, even if I'm not yours.  But I'm sorry anyways because I know it's my fault.  Somehow everything is my fault.	f
What a day!  Why is it my day seems to go wrong when I'm not talking to my honey or when I don't get any morning kiss from him?  He was late today for more than 2 hours....He told me he went to the mall with his mom and sis.  Anyway, he made up for it coz he didn't go to dinner and instead just chatted with me....=)  I have my period and the pain is soooo terribel...then the burger that I ate for breakfast have a half-cooked patti!  I was so pissed off!  But everything is okey now...thanks to my jan.  He made it well for me again. =)	f
"I played some more Halo online with a different friend, Cody, today. It was freaking sweet, I don't remember how many games we played but it was a lot. We mostly got owned but it was fun. Like on Battle Creek, I had a rocket launcher, and I was on the cliff right above Cody's little hiding cave. And some guy practically came up to Cody's face, when I blew him up right infront of Cody, and he was like ""Woah where'd he go?"" That happened a second time not too long after the first one. On that same game, we made a human tower so I could jump onto a dragon tooth ontop of one of the bases. When I got up there I saw a sniper behind this tree and so I started jumping in shooting, it was working for a while because he kept missing, but he finally killed me. Another funny time during our games, was on Hang Em' High. We were on one of the towers with snipers only settings, when I saw a guy come around the tower and was looking at me, so I threw a grenade and ran. Unfortunately, Cody ran right infront of my grenade, so it bounced off his back and exploded. As he was flying toward our enemy he got a headshot on him and landed on his body safely. After he landed another guy tried to kill him and right as Cody tried to punch him, I sniped him right out of Cody's face. There was much more greatness and fun but those were the ones I thought I'd share."	m
Well, Today was good.  COncert of Prayer at Church = awesome.  For only two practices... the band sounded great! In other news:  KTJ promised me that when her shoes wear out, I can have them... because then I can embed one in my throat, because I usually have my foot in my mouth :5 I'm out.	m
