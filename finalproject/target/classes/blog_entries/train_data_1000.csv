"gawd i luv my nanny!  she's absolutely the greatest woman on earth and i dont know where i'd be without her today....  im very nervous about moving up to fredericton when the time comes.... i am accepted into both unb and nbcc and i just have to make a decision on where i want to go.  i should finish up my degree but i just dont know if i can do university NE more.... i mean i nvr thought it would be a problem but this year has been a real eye opener.  i've had to learn an awful lot of HARD lessons and it's all but shattered my confidance.    i guess it's just cuz i cant play dumb and float through life in my naive little bubble NE more.  old habits are really hard to break.... especially 23yr old ones.... damn my parents for sheltering me, and never making me work for NE thing.  i realize how spoiled and self-centered that sounds but still DAMN THEM!!!  it sucks having to walk blindly through this life.  im too old to just say ""oops my bad"" or ""daddy fix this"" whenever i mess up.... im gonna end up doing something irreparable sooner or later.    i already have done some horrible things this year that nobuddy will ever be able to fix.  i hurt someone i dont even know in the absolute WORST possible way ever.  she'll nvr know how i hurt her or even really that's she's been hurt, but i know and i live with it every day of my life.  i also lost a best friend and that hurts a lot too.  i dunno i guess the whole point to this thing is im scared of being out on my own.  im like a child that you have to monitor 24/7 cuz who knows what kind of trouble i can get myself into.  i mean i have Bean and i have a few others in fred i can depend on if i need to and my parents are only an hour away but in the same breath i almost dont want that.  cuz it just makes it that more easier to mess up.  i mean if i have someone there to help me fix it it kind of makes it okay for me to screw up if that even makes sense.... i guess what im trying to say is if i didnt have a support system readily @ hand i'd be more conscience of my actions....  it almost makes me want to say to hell with my life here and go to hfx instead.  but then again kat's down there and as much as i love her i dont think i'd enjoy living in the same city as her....  and as far as not wanting to live in the same city as kat goes, i could say the same for fredericton.  i mean i only know a handful of peeps there but i dont particularly enjoy some of them....  one in particular i dont know how i could bring myself to be civil around them cuz i'd like to beat their face off most days.  well not really but seeing them would bring back a lot of bad memories and im not so great @ putting on a fake smile and acting hunky dory.  i wear my heart on my sleave and i know they'd see right through my faux grinning facade.  that would just be uncomfortable for all involved....  and it's doubtful i'd ever even really run into said person cuz we're completely different people so the only common place we might ever meet up would be like the gas station or something like that.  but still, the concern is there and i dont know if i want to set myself up for an awkward sitution like that....  im amazed i havent run into them yet actually.... i mean im in fred enough as it is, i practically live there....  argh i dont know im all backwards.... back to my nanny i was talking to her about all of this tonight and although she only said ""jamieanne, you will be fine"" it was very assuring.  there's something about her that's just so soothing.  less than a month to go before decision time ARGH!!!  what am i gonna do?  enuff stressing about it for now  much love me  ~xoxo~"	f

well, it's still summer vacation ':-( and I wish things could be better...  Our puppy is starting to seem like the surdery (an expensive one!) didn't do much, so our puppy (Freya) might not last in our house.

The other big problem is  urlLink Elvorix  isn't around therefore I can't borrow his Dragonlance books (these are the best books on the planet FYI)  well, bye	m
Yes! School is out for summer! The sun is shining and life is great! I'm so happy that the weather has finally changed and now it's all sunny! Whistler is in like twelve days...YAY! I'm excited for that, and EMILY COMES HOME in 10 days! I really hope I get to see her before I leave for Whistler, it's been forever!  I got a summer job! At McDonalds. It's actually quite fun there but I suck at till...oh well I'll get used to it!  What am I gonna be doing this summer? Well, not a lot...A LOT of relaxing though! Whistler, Jamee comes to Victoria, Birthday, Working, Tanning....endless possiblilties. Heehee!  Anyways, there isn't a lot to write. I hope I did half decent on my english final, it wasn't too hard.  Luv ya, Lia!	f

"Boring mission. We had another routine presence  patrol in 14E. It was just as uneventful as the last. We got back to the  barracks about 2200 and I decided to take a showerand a nap before our  next mission. Once again, I found myself having difficulty performing a simple  task because I could not take my mind off of Venus. I love you, honey bunny. I  love you so much. I miss you more every day.     It was a quick nap. Our next misson began at 0300,  so preparations started at 0030. We were tasked to provide backup for a group of  British SAS who were conducting a raid in our sector. That is what they told us.  We knew, however, that the SAS was more than capable of handling the situation.  We were there because they were in our sector and the Batallion Commander wanted  some of his guys there to keep an eye on them and to get any glory if there was  any extra lying around. They were going in to get a suspected insurgent and any  paraphenalia they could grab quickly. The plan was simple. We would roll up and  surround the block while the SAS ran up and did one of thier stealthy, lightning  fast, ""knock down the door and make everyone play nice"" routines. Then, two  little birds would land on the roof and pick the SAS and suspect up. It  shouldn't have taken more than two minutes, tops.      It looked really good. I did not see any SAS until  they were in the front yard, not that anyone was awake and would have seen them.  They came back out of the house about 30 seconds later saying that it was the  wrong guy. Bad intel again. The mission was a failure, but at least it was not  our fault. Of course, we would have had no effect on the outcome of the mission,  anyway.      We got back to the barracks before 0400. I was  hungry, but the chow hall was not going to be open again until 0630. I guess I  should have eaten before we left."	m

If you know what the first part of the title means, you've obviously played in a few poker tournaments :)  Its a $30 buy-in tournament with 3 dollars going to the house.  NL stands for No-Limit.  The game in question is Texas Holdem...The Cadillac of Poker  I've been kinda a student to the game of No-Limit Texas Holdem for about 4 years now.  When I was at the Casino a few weeks ago on training (Not poker training, work training, I just stayed at the casino hotel :)), I picked up a few magazines that are delivered to all canadian casinos.  Its called Canadian Poker Player ( urlLink Http://www.canadianpokerplayer.com ).  In the May issue, they had an article regarding home games.  I was very shocked to see that there was an article about a home game right here in Fredericton.  So I sent them an email to get an invite to their weekly home games and monthly tournaments.  Tonight will mark my first NL tournament with this group, and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've been playing with the same group of guys from home for years now, and I pretty much know their betting patterns and strategies.  When you sit down at a table with a completely new crowd, you always learn something new.  I'm very much looking forward to tonight, not only for the game I love, but to meet new people in the city.    Now, off that subject, and maybe a quick response to Fire's post regarding fears....  I never thought I did before, but I really fear death.  I sometimes get this chill in my body whenever I think of what would happen if I died tomorrow, what the (2, maybe 3 ;)) people would do if I was gone.  When I was young, I was kinda a daredevil...I never feared getting hurt, and would do just about anything people dared me to do.  Now that I'm settling down with my life, I fear dying more and more every day.  I wonder why I do.  I guess its the natural life cycle.    I never really noticed this until I started flying.  My trip to Jamaica a few years ago included me almost going nuts in the plane when it was in turbulance.  So, maybe its a combination of fear of death and fear of flying.  Anyway, I swore I wouldn't travel without Melissa on a plane again, she makes me feel more comfortable when I'm with her.  Awwwwwwwww.  Work beckons.	m
"How to handle a ""scandal.""   I have personally witnessed two potential scandals and two different ways of dealing with it. One involved a seminary rector and a number of bishops were involved (they covered it up for as long as they could --several years and then all hell broke loose), the other involved a principal at a Jesuit school (more on this below) where the Jesuit President of the school gathered the entire student body with teachers and we all found out about the allegation at the same time (hell never broke out--the students who were not noteworthy for comportment handled it like men). Cover-up I have found only leads to a bigger scandal, truth extinguishes scandal.   There is a  urlLink news story  today of another incident being handled by the same school I once taught at and if you read the story you'll see the Jesuits are still doing it the same way (at least in the New Orleans province):   The announcement was met by stunned silence."	m

"It really pisses me off in English the way that Laura and Gough scorn everything that either myself or Ryan puts forward. Okay so compared to Ryan my points are minor or negligable I can understand that, and perhaps I lack the vocal eloquence to put it across but that doesn't stop me from holding an opinion which could be valid. Gemma's gone away to a wedding with some old biddies and she is texting me every hour or so. I don't mind, far from it, but I feel guilty cos I'm not texting back, it's not that I don't want to it's just that I'm low on credit as it is and I won't get any more till the 28th which is gay, but that's life. I'm trying to search for a song that I can listen to that isn't too upbeat, and isn't depressing and that I haven't heard a million times before... I'm probably gonna digress into Three Doors Down but I'm being happy because I know that's important to you, and if it's important to you then I will try my best. Puddles agreed that I was nice against Ryan... well actually she said that ""Yeah, you're nice now"" I don't really want to think what she means by now, I would be offended probably. Summer does weird things to me... or maybe that's the exams, I feel really tired and wound up... I reckon that's just school in general though so I don't know. ""Oh we're half way there, living on a prayer, take my hand, we'll make it I swear"". Mayflies keep ramming into the pavillion windows probably cos of the lights but damn they're huge, see I found out what they're called, they look like killer moth wasps to me but I'll call them Mayflies. Reflecting I'm just being pedantic I seem to obsess into melodrama and so if something goes wrong then my whole world comes crashing down... I'm too emotional, stupid things can get to me, but I try not to let them show to other people, mainly cos they're stupid and I know they shouldn't bother me... and yet it does. I'm really tired and to tell the truth I have no idea what hours I'm working tomorrow I was going to find out today but I never went in which means I'm going to have to go over early tomorrow morning to find out... which as you can imagine sucks pretty badly. Oh well, I've nobody to say sweet dreams to, or n'night, and nobody to tell me that it's alright, it's okay... and nobody to hug me... hmm melodrama. I'm tempted to xhx this but I'll leave it be.

"The kids had a great time at the pool yesterday afternoon splashing around and diving for pennies.  While we were there, a reporter came around from the local paper and was snapping pictures of the kids and taking names.  He took special interest in the fact it was my son's birthday and took some extra pictures of him and his brother.  So, I guess I need to check out this weekend's edition of the paper to see if the kids pictures show up.  The children would get a real kick out of it to see their pictures in the newspaper.    My son also got to take treats to his church group last night and they all sang ""Happy Birthday"" to him - he loved the attention!  The leaders at that group are amazing!  The staff members that are men are wonderful role models for both the children.  Until we meet again......"	f

Ladies and gentlemen, today I made my parents proud by being immortalized in history by 17 words made in passing reference to my role as an eagle in the Desmoines Register today. Here they are:       Impressive no? Hahaha well maybe not, but I was still impressed. In other news, I had a full set of physical examinations today to see if I'm qualified for West Point (the college I'm trying to get into). The high point of that was probably when the doctor was finishing the *cough* *cough* hernia check, he told to me bend over, and I swear to god my life flashed before my eyes. Luckily for me, the doc had been doing the hernia exam without gloves(eeew), so he passed on the rectal examination(I have no idea what he was actually looking for back there). I have to give my guardian angel props for that one. Other exciting events of the day include finally getting my laptop back from repair. Unfortunately though, the genius's down at the repair facility forgot to fedex the power adapter with the laptop, so all I have is one battery charge before its useless again. I called them up and gave them a piece of my mind, so hopefully they get on the stick and next-day air that sucker up to me tomorrow. Until then, I'm out!	m
"Physical education.  Some days it is good.  Some days it is not.  I guess it all depends on whether or not my body feels like learning.  There are other factors though too.  Amount of sunlight, temperature, wind chill, heat index, how the classes before went, what we are playing, and the other people on my team are just a few.  Today started out alright, drifted up, came down, shot skyward, and plummeted back down again.  I guess I just don't understand people.  People don't understand me though so I guess the feeling is mutual.  Speaking of being misunderstood, I am sick of people saying ""You just don't understand"" or ""It doesn't matter what I look like.  It's what on the inside that counts.""  I do understand. You are shallow.  What is on the outside does mater.  Generally, it reflects the inside.  You are probably not the exception.  Whoah!  That was a little off the beaten path. Where was I?  Oh right!  I just don't understand people.  I am wicked competitive.  I HATE losing!  I used to be the worst loser ever.  Then in second grade, I grew up.  Hasn't happened yet in my gym class.  I was a fairly poor winner too until probably ninth grade.  I have mostly grew out of that though.  Anyways, PE can be fun.  People get way too aggressive.  I mean ""play hard""!  Hoo-rah!  Inside of the rules though.  Punching the ground, flipping benches, and throwing students generally are not in the rules.  I am 99%  sure that putting up your middle finger when the teacher turns his back is not in the rules.  Swearing probably goes right along with that but that is more widespread than just PE.  And then there is the making fun of people.  I find it comical when a un-named 400 pound sophmore throws a temper tantrum and hits stuff and swears and lays on the ground holding himself and over-exagerates his injuries.  I am sorry but I really want to inflict actual pain on the pansy when he does that.  Not trying to get pity, I would like to mention that I however ripped through three layers of clothing and my knees, tore open my elbow, received a huge gash to my lower back, and scraped my palms today.  I did not lay on the ground and try to get the gym class to surround me and ask if I was ok.  I got up...then walked over to the side and quietly sat down because my knee hurt.  I feel bad for the seniors.  Sure they say absolutely idiotic stuff but they deal with a lot of unwarranted aggression.  The sophmores, who in general are...the coolest kids I know *cough**nose grows*, give the seniors alot of verbal and physical abuse.  The seniors for the most part don't have much to say back.  I admire the amount of verbal crap they take.  I see them tense up, and then let it roll off.  Not too many people do that today.  I mean after so much, problems escalate but hey what can you do?  BTW me falling I know that must sound funny because it also involves me being ""active"".  Here is the deal yo.  I was bored in gym.  I didn't want to participate because I have no skill and can't outrun your grandmother.  Yes I meant the one with the walker.  So I just kept walking and then Mr.Doan would walk up and tag me and I would smile and walk back and tap the dumpster and then I would walk back and do it again.  And again.  And again.  Well then something unexpected happened.  I walked through and picked up a cone.  Then I took off as fast as I could.  Again, this is not to fast.  Well I am running and running, trying to get back to the dumpster as fast as I could and I am looking backward to see if I am about to be tagged.  Sidenote:  Me running is dangerous.  Me walking and looking backward is dangerous.  Me running and looking back is a volatile mix.  On the my erratic journey across the blacktop, SO CLOSE TO THE DUMPSTER, my feet had a little disagreement about something(I couldn't hear too well cuz my ears are so far away and I didn't want to stop and ask at the time), and then the blacktop and I had some one-on-one time.  I ripped through my second favorite pair of pants.  No not the gym pants.  I was wearing these awesome pajamas under my pants as I always do and now I have holes in my knees and this wonderful spot where the blood dried.  mmm...That was a joy to pull from my leg.  Then I did my homework.  Mr.Gomez I put my heart into that paper.  Actually, just some blood from my wrist.  It was an awkward place for a band-aid so I just decided to bleed on the paper.  Not too much.  Just enough to remember me by.  I got the package in the mail.  It said ""STRAIGHT TALK"" on the front in cool letters on the front and my first thought was ""I don't remember joining any supremacy groups.""  As it turns out, it was just a little dvd on BJU and ""the facts"" about campus life.  funny stuff..."	f

"RAMBLING INCOHERENCE by Jason Latour     Well, it's another late Sunday nightor Monday morning, ratherand I have decided to write, the response to which I understand causes great rejoicing by the Iraqi people. Honestly I mean not to get into all that war talk again, but what doesn't cause the Iraqi people to rejoice anymore? It's like its free chalupa time at Taco Bell everyday, all day, over there now. Well, at least according to CNN, it is. I think what the Iraqi people need right now is some good service-station-brand ripple to celebrate with. I mean honestly, ripple is always cause for cheerespecially strawberry ripple.   Mmmm ripple...  As long as I'm RAMBLING INCOHERENT-ly, I saw on Bill Mahr a while back that Texas is trying to increase the laws against sodomy in their statemaking it punishable by death or something ridiculous like that. For those of you that don't know, ""sodomy"" is defined as:   ""Any of various forms of sexual intercourse held to be unnatural or abnormal, especially anal intercourse or bestiality.""  The notion of outlawing sodomy, is in my mind,ridiculous becausehonestlywho defines what is deviant and what's not? Some people might think letting the woman get on top or doing it ""doggy"" style is deviant. Or strapping on a Louisville Slugger and strangling your partner to the sound of Beethoven's Fifth symphony--- honestly, who among us hasn't wanted to donkey punch our lover now and then? It might be rude but it's certainly not illegal or immoral activity in my eyes. Just stay away from the kids and barnyard animals and you're okay in my book, I guess. But that said, I would probably have sex with a cow, if it had a nice ass and some big sexy breasts...  It brings up the age-old question of who defines what is immoral for another? Take for example myself. I'm the ripe old age of 26, which in my new found home of Gainesville, Florida, is looked upon as being about the equvialent of Yoda or that old guy with the booger finger from THE GOLDEN CHILD. Being a 26-year-old man in a town populated by beautiful, sexually ripe 1821-year-old women is hard on the constitution. It's unbelievable. Now, I used to say, ""I'd never touch a high school girl""which basically the freshmen girls around here still arebut when it's in your faceand I mean literally in your faceman, let's just say the temptation is GREAT. So great that it makes me want to grab a bottle of that aforementioned strawberry ripple and get REALLY REALLY REALLY schnauzelled. Because under the influence, we all know that it's okay to just say that you didn't know. But then you're entering Kobe Bryant territory and no one wants that.   Ah, Kobe. The whole thing is mind-numbingly stupid. I thought he was a giant idiot when I first heard he married a 19-year-old who was fresh out of high school. When you live in a world where fame and popularity determine sex status so mightily that Demi Moore is jumping Aston Kutcher, you just don't marry a 19-year-old girl (no matter how hot she is)! Then to make matters worse, once you get tired of that ""old hag"" you've got at home, you jump the first preteen beer-tub girl that slants you the sweet eye. And then he either forces her to have sex with him (when we all know that there are millions of hot young women out there who would do it for free) or he just gets way ""too"" freaky (based on the bruises and missing hairs and such) and she can't take it when he leaves. When you're in the the public eye you just don't do that stuff. My advice to Kobe in the future is: if you can't keep in holstered then follow the lead of our mutual idol, Michael Jordan. Keep it on the DL with older women who know the deal. A 30-year-old basketball groupie isn't running home crying to her parentsno matter what happens. She's two-way paging her girlfriends to brag about the new Benzo she's pushing with the money you fronted her to keep quiet. Now I know this sounds hypocritical coming from me based on what I said earlier, but you have to realize that Kobe and I ain't exactly playing on the same ball field. He's in the majors and I'm slumming in the optimist league.   So, what did we learn today? That if if you're travelling to Texas and you have a pention for sex with underage barnyard life don't be a Kobekeep it on the down low!"	m
"Well, I had fun. I did surprisingly well on recognizing people without having to read their name tags first (although there were a couple of ""no waayyyssss"").

The funny thing is, I wouldn't have picked to live here. Like many things in my life, it just sorta happened, and I have learned to live with it. Only this time, I've come to love it. I seem able to do that quite a lot - is that part of the easygoing Pisces thing? I dunno. And it's only cold here in the winter - right now, it's anything but. Beautiful, actually. I've had all the windows open all weekend. Except for the bedroom ones, because they're right by the door to the building, and that's none of anyone's business....  Yeah, the whole tollway thing sucks. The first time I drove home to Ohio, I took the Skyway, which was a TWO DOLLAR TOLL!!! I was stunned. I'll have to tell the cop story from that trip sometime, too. I think of it as they charge money to leave, too. The cool thing is that I'm learning how to go around the tolls..... All sorts of surface streets!  Yeah, well when you think about all the icky animal stuff I bring home on a daily basis, I'm not real worried about your contribution. :) As far as finding you, well.... I'm smarter than I look. And you can search on gender, age, and location. And I recognized the speech pattern, before I even saw the pics. Funny, huh?	f

Sometime back in May 2003 I was very low on my spirits and happend to write this thing- one of the only three postings on my previous blog. Just posting it here for my own satisfaction. The questions of our existence, which still remain unanswered to me -  Sometimes in life we get serious, and realize we should have been serious long way back. But I wonder, should anyone get serious at all ? Afterall, it seems we tend to not enjoy the little things which one should in every day life. Or am I overdoing things ? What is the secret to happiness ? Aspire, aim and achieve, or be happy with what one's got ? What do we live for ? What is the final aim ? Is there any ? Is it the satisfaction in cherishing every moment of your life ? Then why cry for something you couldn't achieve instead of being happy within ? Is it so simple ? Or is it out of our comprehension ?  Ankur.	m
"Yesterday as we were walking through The Grove (a shopping mall of sorts), I told Will that he'd better get me a switch for my stocking, as he'd already given me a lump of coal. I waited a minute for him to get it, and was all set to wave my left hand wildly in his face when he laughed.  I've developed a really obnoxious habit. Whenever Will leaves the apartment - even if it is just to run down the hall to the trash cute - I say, ""Go with God."" I think I also said this to him once when he was headed to the bathroom. I really don't know what has gotten into me."	f
This song is sung by one of my most favorite rock bands and “his” favorite too, Linkin Park. It’s about breaking away from something that you have been loving obsessing about because it hurts you so much, resistance is futile and no matter how much you say that you can fight for it, you no longer can.   When I took a quiz on the net, the results said that this song is for the one I love, or let’s call him my ex-ai. It’s also a coincidence that this band is also my ex-ai’s favorite. I find this song appropriate because the band clearly expressed the pain and confusion when you have to let go of something you found to be part of your “daily dose”, when you have to “break away from the habit”.  I am not a drug addict, but the way I have been obsessing about my ex-ai is like a woman hooked on marijuana and heroine since her childhood years.  I’m not exaggerating, I guess it’s just like that when you’re in love with someone who treats you like another stranger in their life… you keep on being rejected, the stronger is the surge to get him. At first, it was just your normal dose then as days go by, the drive increases until it becomes a habit which eventually turns into addiction. Of course it hurts to have all my love be fixated exclusively for one person only, but who cares? Even if I’m being called brainless despite my high IQ, I really don’t care… the only thing I care about is I see my ex-ai and talk to him, which I always thought would turn out be something more serious than that.        Memories consume Like opening the wounds I’m picking me apart again You all assume I’m safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  The first stanza, oh yes… it’s all about the memories and the pain and the façade. The whole entourage is here. I tried to forget him, really I did. I have collected all the things I have which remind me of him and ask my best friend to keep it. I have written him a six-page long letter on how I fell for him, love him and eventually hate myself for loving him, but that letter was just kept in my drawer, and I always read it that’s why memories always come back to haunt me. Whenever I see him it all comes back, the times when he tried to make friends with me, when my friend told me that he liked me when I was still a freshman in high school, when he smiles at me and when he fools around with me. All these memories and so much more are just ripping me apart into pieces. It hurts me so much just to think about him. I tell my friends that I don’t care a bit about him but the truth us just I put on a brave face so that they won’t know how foolish I am when it comes to love. They all think that I have moved on because I am now diverting my attention to other guys, but the truth is… it’s all just an act. When I’m alone though you think I’m alright, I’ll never be alright.             I don’t want to be the one The battles always choose Cause inside I realize That I’m the one confused  Now we have the refrain, yes I am confused. I don’t know how the heck I got myself in this position but I’m here so there’s no turning back. At this point, though I am going into another phase in my life, I can’t seem to let go of that past which clings tightly unto me, but a part of me says that I have to, for my own good.  I feel so torn between the mixed feelings I have. It’s driving me crazy up to the point I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. I don’t want to be put in this kind of situation but it is fate that chose that I have to deal with this and while I’m at it, fate decided to give me a taste of hell.   Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more that anytime before I have no options left again  Before I proceed to the chorus, let’s go to the second line first. I have a cure, or at least a temporary one. It’s redirecting my attention to other guys who I see, which end up being temporary diversion only. But the more I try to deny all the feelings I have inside and the more I try to use my cure, the greater is the pain. I just end up comparing the guys I meet to him and I just give any guy who comes near me a nil chance which seems really unfair.  And now I am stuck with no alternative, I can’t cure it. But I realized something that the reason I can’t cure it is because I am afraid of losing him in my heart. The pain became a part of me that I no longer can let go of it. It’s like the pain is what I live for and it shadows all the sense left in me. It sounds weird but now I realize it.  I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? I don’t know why I instigate, And say what I don’t mean I don’t know how I got this way I know it’s not alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight…  The chorus, the most hard-hitting words in the song are here. Yes, I have no idea what I am fighting for, if it is the love I feel or the obsession to experience the feeling of having someone love me which I lost in him. I don’t know why I want to hurt to myself for one person who does not know me deeply. I don’t know why I keep on doing this to myself. Maybe because the feeling of regret and pain clouded my sanity to the point that I don’t know what to do with all the emotions I feel. I don’t know why I say some things that I know in my heart I don’t mean. Like when I say that I am okay when I am not, when I said that I don’t like him when I do. That’s when I realized that these feelings cannot be denied because the more I do that the harder it is for me to overcome all the pain. There is no other way that to face the worst pain I ever encountered so far and while I’m facing it, I have to let go of the source of the pain though I find myself at a certain point that its hard to break away from the habit, the habit of seeing and having mixed emotions when I see him, reality came crashing down that I just need to say adios to the habit of him…       I’ll paint it on the walls Coz I’m the one at fault I’ll never fight again And this is how it ends  Yes, as sang by Linkin Park at the Coda, I am the one at fault. These things would never have happened if only I had been more careful about the feelings I give to others. These things would never have occurred if only I had not fought the feelings I suppressed when he used to like me. I would never have to go through all these if only I had been more open-minded to the things that could possibly be. I would never have to stick to the feeling of pain if only I had to learn to let go of it beforehand. And most of all, I would have never written this if only I had decided to break away from him before he became someone that I would find myself hard to live without though he only causes me pain. All these could have been avoided if only I stopped myself from hurting my feelings and stopped liking and loving him completely. So, yes, it is my fault and I am trying my best to make up for that mistake.     I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don’t know how I got this way I’ll never be alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight    This is the last chorus, the last few lines in the song. I am trying to break away from the habit, though it’s hard to do, I am doing my best and I hope it is good enough. I can never be TOTALLY ALRIGHT because he has inflicted serious wounds here in my heart. But I realized that I can’t exactly dwell on these feelings forever because it’s not healthy for me or the people around me. I can’t let people wait for me to be completely happy because for the longest time they had exerted effort for me to be close to him or give me chances, but I guess I and my ex-ai will never be… our fates are not intertwined with each other. But who knows?  Maybe in the future we will meet again and maybe when we see each other he will no longer be a habit, but just a memory that I can live without. But I know, deep inside my heart he will always and forever be a part of me that I never can completely let go of.	f

"By J.R. Engeriser    In times of terror and war, it might be nice to reflect back on the Gospels of Jesus for a little wisdom. He, undeniably, was an extremely bright individual and had great ideas. Non-Zionists, stay with me on this. Over the next little while I will be revisiting the Gospels and throwing out an occasional post that might even shake the hypocrisy out of a Bushite. The current administration here in Gods country isn't very  urlLink WWJD .  The Jesus people have stopped listening to their own guy.  As a mood setter, Jesus Flash #1 comes from Mark 2:23-28, where Jesus talks to the Pharisees. Pharisees were the religious leaders of Jesus time. They used the peoples respect for scripture to control and swindle.  urlLink Jesus slammed the Pharisees  whenever he had a chance.     [23] One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.  [24] And the Pharisees said to him, ""Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?""  [25] And he said to them, ""Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:  [26] how he entered the house of God, when Abi'athar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?""  [27] And he said to them, ""The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath;  [28] so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.""    Sometimes you have to break the rules. After all, the rules are made for us, not us for the rules. Notice that David stole bread, not just any bread, but holy bread, because he and his associates were in need. And, it was okay by Jesus. Starving yourself for the sake of following rules did not make sense to Jesus, because at that point the rules would no longer serve, but hinder.   Jesus questioned authority and rules. How else were things going to change? Not by sitting idle. He rebelled and started a revolution.   In the 1930s, a man named Joseph Rutherford, the leader of the Jehovahs Witness movement at that time, declared, Religion is a snare and a racket! His followers would walk up and down the streets with placards around their necks advertising this slogan. He said ""Religion is the worship and service of the Devil and his associate demons .... Religion is the chief means that puts fear into the minds of the people and leads them into the Devil's snare .... Truly then, as stated, 'religion is a snare and a racket,' employed to collect money from them under false representations.""   Problem was, Rutherford, while saying these words, was starting a religion. It went downhill from there. But, he set out with the right idea. When religion does bad things to us, like start wars, break up families, or exploit our trust, its time to put the people running the show in the same category as the Pharisees. Jesus said  ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.""  -Matthew 23:27"	m

Today me and a friend decided to stop being lazy and to setup a LAN over at his house, in the basement. I have to say, it was great fun. However it took us two hours to get the LAN working... Because we're morons.  The reason the LAN wouldn't work, the entire 2 hours, was because we forgot to disable my firewall. DUH! I guess the fact that we had both been up for 10+ hours might have had something to do with it, however I am not sure. Stupid I guess...  I got the full version of Halo from him, however it doesn't work online. (Sadly) Still, that is cool and I can still use the Trial to get my multiplayer fix, heh.

Ok. This is the begining of my 'personal' blog. I'm not gonna write in this every day. Only when I feel it's necessary. It's going to be about who I like and stuff like that. So last person I went out with was Craig and i still kind of like him. The thing is I know I should just forget about it and move on. So i'm trying i guess. At the park Matt Wisneski comes and visits a lot because his sister goes there and I thought i liked him for a while. I'm not really sure anymore tho. First off he's only gonna be a 9th grader. So I've never even dated anyone my age let alone younger then me. On the other hand he's really funny and I love when he's there. Ok .. then I kind of think I like Al who works at the park with me. See he's 18. I play basketball with him and wow is that fun. Lets just say we get somewhat physical with it haha. We were playing 1 on 1 =) I also play checkers and spit with him.. and i always loose but that's Ok. He's a freshman in college tho so i'm not sure if that's too old or whatnot tho. I also dont know if he just thinks of me as a little girl. Matt knows that i kind of like him now but i dont think they really talk so that might not help. I liked him last year a little too but i didn't really talk to him as much. I guess with two weeks of the park left I better figure it out before it's too late. But I guess that's it for now and I will post again when something changes. --peace; kacie	f
I'm writing this page in response to a need that I've found increasingly strong in myself during the last year.  I found that my mind would become cluttered with various thoughts, reminiscences, and concerns, while I also tried to work through a number of practical matters at the same time.  During that time, I decided to keep a journal, to do one of two things: 1) Move my trivial thoughts into a concrete setting so that I could focus on more practical matters, or 2) Write down something profound and practical, so that I would be free to dwell on pleasant thoughts and imaginings.  As it turns out, neither of these matters have been settled, but I have found an interest in writing that has grown stronger as I wrote more. Somehow, it's comforting to see the chaos of impulses, dreams, and desires that swirls inside of me laid into some order that I can follow.   I will return soon with an introduction, and more pictures.  Here is the first one.  Enjoy...	m

"So  urlLink Blogger  was down this morning for a while; hope I remember the things I wanted to link up.  I can't seen to get the  urlLink Dallas Police Department Web site  to load, but  urlLink this story  says the department is posting pictures of  alleged  johns. If they've not been convicted, couldn't there be some trouble here?

Here's a  urlLink story from Slate  offering corrections of myths about Reagan:  ""(1) Reagan, the ""Great Communicator,"" owed his success mainly to his facility with television and public relations; (2) Reagan was a uniter, not a divider; (3) Reagan was an incorrigible optimist; (4) Reagan restored faith in government and the presidency; (5) Reagan's get-tough policy with the Soviet Union brought about the end of the Cold War.""

"me back after a break. was not able to post anything since the last few for one reason or the other...came back from blore, met her one night, roamed about and departed after a bit of ""saalu saalu""...ha ha ha, i dont think i will ever forget this word!   talked to vishnu yesterday and came to know that his visa was rejected..became really upset after that...are these the signs of things to come! talked to ravi, tarun, shruti, and lots of people about this and when i saw that nothing was really helping me, thought that i should stop thinking about it. actually, there is little that anybody can do in this case. I mean, ultimately you have to reason it out yourself. well, told gyandu that i would be coming to his house in the evening..actually wanted to run away from all this.   saw ""day after tomorrow"" last evening...pretty dekheble movie. good graphics...to put it on record here, everytime i say something like this, i start thinking about the opinions of the people in front of me..as in what are they thinking and all, are they thinking the same way or not. But then, this is MY oponion...maybe, this shows the level of confi the concerned person is having at that moment, and i am surely nowhere near my peak of confidence as of now!! he he...maybe i am overanalysing things while i write blog, but then there is nothing wrong in that... :-)  nothing more than all these to write actually...the feeling in the stomach is getting stranger and stranger as the D day is coming nearer and nearer!  well...yes, the subject. 'n' number of centuries back, people used to communicate by 'kabootars', then came the stage where emmisaries were sent, then came the concept of writing and letters came in the vogue. write your message on a piece of paper...put a stamp (or dont put it) and post...viola! the other person gets it in some days. simulataneously came fax, telegram, private couriers etc etc. then came the internet revolution and with it came the e-mail. was pretty fast, convinient.....and a good timepass!! then came the messenger - the instant messenger..was still faster...now i guess the latest entrant is our very own blog. read the other person's blog, make your own comments in your blog, the other person reads yours and replies (for convinience you can paste the blog you are referring to, in your own post!)...with the tacit understanding that this will never be discussed in person...ha ha ha....way to go! lets see what new things come up ;-)"	m

"This post is dedicated to  Sparky    It has been  one hell of a long year .  I had to work at home last Fathers' Day while my poor little man was in the hospital, recovering from a blood transfusion.  Had I known that I would never bring him home again (alive), I'd have taken off the next day and not have done that fucking transport when I could have had at least one more visitation with him.  The day after he died, I cried so hard I started throwing up.  I remember the evening of his death, sitting on my den floor, doing one shot of vodka after another while my mom kept telling me that this wasn't the way to handle it.  The very next weekend I went out and got my  Sparky tattoo .  It took my mom an entire month to send me a sympathy card.  She kept trying to write in it but couldn't, as every time she was overtaken by tears.  I cried every time I read the cards I received, so I finally put them away in my memory box for the  little fat guy .  Paddy liked to call him ""Tubbs.""  I once threw a complete stranger out of my house (well, bitched at him until he left) because he made a cruel remark about Sparky's weight.  Sparky would come running when I'd say, ""My little man"" or ""scratchy?""  And he couldn't help it that he was fat.   He ignored me when I called him by his real name.   People didn't know how to handle me there for a while.  I had one potential buyer for a property we owned who made a snide remark about ""being upset about a dead dog"" and I came this close to chewing his weasely little snarky ass out.  But I needed my job.  I still hate that motherfucker with a  passion .  Sparky's eulogy got forwarded to people across the country, people I didn't even know.  There are so many people out there who understood what I was going through.  And some who didn't.  Those who didn't, I'd swerve to miss a squirrel if they were both in my path.  And I don't really like squirrels all that much.  My makeup is running down my cheeks as I type.  Never a  truer love  have I known, not one so unconditional.  Sparky always knew when I was upset.  Even now, all three dogs I have don't become nearly as upset as my Sparky did when momma was crying.  He tried my patience.  He made me cuss up a blue streak.  I would spend 100 times over what I spent to keep him alive - all VERY MUCH WORTH IT.  He annoyed the hell out of Mark Pittman.  Paddy loved him almost as much as I did.  He was my fucking savior.  And I was his for a very short time.  A piece of my heart and soul was taken from me at 2:25 p.m. on June 17, 2003.  Those of you who cannot understand this can FUCK OFF.  Those of you who do,   I love you  .   God bless My Little Man.   How very much I loved him.  Sparky December 1, 1999 - June 17, 2003  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend"	f
it was actually grellow (my bad) and it's pieter's blog--------duhH?	m
"Hey gals! Time to catch up! I was only gone for about an hour this morning- boy did I ever luck out.  Supposedly I'm good for two years now.  LOL- makes me wonder if I should have already been good- I just went last August.  Either way, it's a 3 day weekend for me-yay!!  I've been getting laundry done  going through yesterday's tape.  I took a *bunch* of photos.  Yesterday was a great hottie day!  Today was ok (since Todd was on a bit- same story, but that's ok). There's something burning outside somewhere- it's smelled like smoke for the last 2 hours or so.  Hopefully it's nothing nearby  not my storage unit.  :-/  Jen- I got your email  need to reply to ya.  Great to see ya posting though! :)  Sorry the oompas are paying a visit.  I will definitely try to catch you on AIM this weekend since it'll be email only once school starts for you next week.   Study abroad would be great!  If I hadn't been so relationship bound (mentally, as I see myself as being so boyfriend-dependent (read as: clingy))  I might've done that.  That BF later turned first marriage really axed a lot that I could have done- but as they say hindsight is 20/20.  (OOOH- Todd's on Fox Report!)  Ya know, between watching that tape from yesterday  what I've seen of Todd today, I've got to have good dreams tonight!  MMMMMM HMMMMMMMM.......LOL!!  ANYWAY.....If you have the chance to do the study abroad, girl, I'd go for it.  We'd miss you, but that's what email is for, and I'm sure you'd have access there at the library of wherever you choose to go. ;)  Wow, girl, you poor thing!  To have lost so many family members to cancer.  I've had a cousin (like a once removed cousin or something like that) and a great great aunt die of cancer, but we seem to have more heart related problems in my family.  I lost both grandpas to heartattacks (one at 53 and the other at 64).  I remember my dad's dad, but my sister was 2 months away from being born when he died.  We've had a close family friend and I lost a coworker last year to breast cancer.  I'm planning on doing the 'walk for the cure' this year in memory of her.  I really like what you wrote about the book of prayers that they have at your mass.  That's so powerful!  Nan- I agree- Leslie will have to share her 'interesting dreams' with us- *some* of us here don't have exciting dreams! We need to live vicariously through ya'll who *do* have great dreams. LOL!    The contacts were a bit better last night- other than the initial burning, the only other thing is that my right eye (more muscle wise) is sore after I wear them for a time.  I'm very sure that it's a stronger prescription 'cause God knows I can see better detail on stuff with the new ones.  Definitely worth going through the temporary pain.  I think these things take time to get used to- glad your glasses are getting a bit better.  I still listen to quite a bit of 70's stuff like Frampton, Eagles, Santana, etc because it reminds me of home  my family (I was raised on classic rock- I used to say I have 'hip parents').  It's comfort music to me.  LOL- poor Rick!  Don't let Joan Rivers get to him- she'll rip him to shreds for his clothing choices that day LOL!  (Also to Jan)- I haven't seen the Will  Grace episode, but it sounds hilarious!  I'm *really* sorry to hear about your dad's cancer coming back.  You know you can *always* count on us if you need a shoulder or more.  Also remember that doctors don't always know everything and that the mind has a big role in how things go a lot of the time.  I tend to react the same way- put my head in the sand and hope that when I come out again, everything will be like it was before (all better).  You're not a downer! Like everyone else said, we're all here for you.  I'll be praying for you!  Know what you're saying about the whole aids thing- that's been our argument too- that it's totally preventable and yet they get all the attention.  Just sickening.....  Kevin said I should put my concerns in writing to HR.  I probably should.  I notice that they're taking more visible action now- I'm definitely going to bring home just about everything I have there (desk decorating stuff) which is disheartening because it does really give more comfort to the day; I'd rather have it than not, though.  I need to talk to my co-worker again- I Yahoo IM'd her this morning, but since we don't know who's checking what she can't tell me *all* of what's going on.  She's doing ok, but shaky.  She was one of the ones whose cords were cut but they also defaced some of her pictures she had up and wrote something really bad on one of them- something threatening.  I worry about her because she's pregnant (like 4 months) and don't want anything to happen.  She was my mentor when I first started so we've been semi close.  You're right- this is CA, the land of the lawsuits!  Good luck to Logan on his tennis tournament tomorrow!! : )    Sherry- Nope- no trial- but I tell ya, I was holding my breath when she was reading off the names of the people who were to go downstairs to the courtroom.  I only had to wait another 10 minutes before what was left of us there were dismissed.  There really weren't that many people that showed up- and it was to have been groups 2 through 23 that were to have reported.  Last time I went there were a lot more people.  They probably called to reschedule- LOL!  I think if I wasn't working and had nothing else going on, it'd be interesting.  LOL, I must've just missed the Rosen/mole thing this morning.  I had it on, but was probably in the other room at the time.    Melissa- No Rick today as far as I could tell.  I like Todd's hair that way too.  It's so funny, 'cause when you look at his Fox photo (in the bios), it hardly looks like him- he needs to update his bio photo! LOL  He is really cute the way he looks now.... you know what's funny, is that his nose reminds me of Kevin's.  Has a sorta similar shape or something.   I caught Fox  Friends for the last 45 minutes.  I'm not crazy about that Kathy chick they had on (she's ok- kinda funny, but was starting to get on my nerves), and Richard Simmons....well, I'll just leave that at that.  I should have taped it too, but wasn't thinking last night.  I loved the croc guy when he was wrestling the stuffed alligator and then Brian says ""bad news- he's got a son!"" ROFLMAO!!  There were some other funnies, but I forget now what they were (bad, huh?). OMG- I'd be freaking out if I saw my keys hanging from the front door!  Look on the bright side- you'll probably never do it again- LOL!  Sounds like something I would do given the opportunity.  Actually, my version would be more like dropping my keys into the water.   LOL- poor Palkot- between he and Tobin, we're always teasing them one way or another, LOL!  I completely missed the Just  Kelly thing- I was so engrossed in catching up on the blog LOL!  And I'm *right* in front of the TV too....sad!    Jayel- Despite only seeing the last 45 minutes of Fox  Friends, I was also hoping for some Fox reporters to show up or have replays of them.  Aww, how thoughtful of you to put the Bible verses there for Nan! :)  I know it's been said before, but feel the need to say it again:  I'm proud of our little group here and how we're all here for one another.  ***group hug*** LOL at your jury duty story- I *know* I'd have that same look on my face.  I was laughing to myself when I left there today that they probably saw I'm a registered Republican and thought ""oh, get rid of her- don't call her name"".  I was hoping for Rick today too....especially since I was off for most the day.  Wow, if Dan has already left Iraq, he didn't stay very long.  Maybe he was 'relief' for Greg P.  LMAO about the Greg P. analogy!  Too true....  Have you gals ever checked out the ""Say What?!"" portion of the Fox Fan portion of Fox's site?  There's some good stuff on there (including James Rosen's Howard Cosell  Muhammad Ali impressions).  Rick's in there too- with Shep when he did the bear story (about the sleeping bag  Shep keeping more than food in his sleeping bag).  They also have a Fox  Friends video there with some of best moments.  I haven't watched that one yet, but it can be found here at  urlLink The Very Best! .  The ""Say What?!"" archive is at  urlLink Say What? Archive .  I *think* the bear thing is in the July 18th one."	f
"Working through my considerable backlog of mailing list posts, I find that a couple of days ago,  urlLink The World Conflict Discussion List  recieved a subscription request from an individual who was either a supporter or a member of Al-qaeda. It is quite proper that Al-qaeda should be able to engage in dialogue on this list, the purpose of which (save you clicking through) is:   ""to bring together the diverse groups presently engaged in warfare to discuss their views and experiences on an individual basis. It is hoped that we can foster understanding and perhaps convince people that words not bombs can effect compromise and change that will lead to peace"""	m
"""Isn't mainframism great"": a discussion.  Jamie: Well i think that computers are the future. John : I heartily agree and strongly believe in the pervading culture of mainframism. Jamie: without wanting to appear solipsistic though some people think mainframes could one day replace any human contact. I think  this  would not be a good idea. John:  Or could  this  be a good thing?  Undoubtedly and without a doubt no. Jamie: Never mind the buzzcocks, what about me? I think that humans are the source of all good but yet all evil as well.  Therefore to eradicate evil we must eradicate good.  This should probably involve castrating bishops and popes. Eh? what say you? Eh? Eh? what. tell me what? Eh?               EH? John:  Sounds a bit like the basic plot structure of arguably the greatest movie of all time; the one with Christian Bale and Sean Bean in it...but without the Bishop and Pope castration...and guns...Equilibrium.  Ace.   Jamie:  Ah. Haven't seen it, but it sounds  rubbish . Anyway the best thing about mainframes is of course the intelligent banter and well rounded arguments we have on this here blog  NO. its not. its b oo bies.  b oo bies! ha. John:  And bums.   That's all for now.  Goodnight everyone, sleep well. Jamie:  what? Ok. Fine yes. Bye."	m
I feel like I'm going into one of my depressive states again. I get these quite often. One day I'll be higher than high and the next I'll be lower than low. I don't know what triggers this dramatic change, but it sucks. I get like this whenever I PMS, and I know that's what's happening this time. But other times, it's just too much and I don't know what to do. So I do what makes me feel better. I know what I do is wrong, but I don't know any other way. I hate how this feeling can come into my life and completely take over, causing me to do things I wouldn't normally do.   I'm so confused and lost in this endless cycle. Endless cycle; there's a redundant statement. Anyway, I don't know what to do here. I need help, but who can help me? Nobody knows what I'm going through. The best they can do is listen. And then there's Mark. What do I do about him? I'm so happy when we're together and I'm so completely in lust with this guy and he shouldn't have to put up with me and my lack of emotional stability. I don't want to lose him, I don't want to let him go but I don't want to keep him either. Not if what I can't deal with is going to ruin our relationship. Please help me ... somebody!	f

It's official, I'm getting better...  I can breathe again!! But not well enough to smell the incense-like aroma lingering around in the office (don't ask me.. I share my cubicle with a beagle that insists that he smells incense! Whatever!)  I should write an entry on the importance of taking what you want in school so you're happy with your job afterwards...  Not having a post-secondary education SUCKS, and i certainly can't wait till i finish my program cause paper pushing is certainly NOT the life for me..  Having said that, I got lots to push!

"I have to give credit to Israel for at least one officials willingness to exhaust all diplomatic solutions regarding Iran's nuclear program.   ""All diplomatic efforts should beexhausted before considering more drastic measures to stop Iran's nuclear programme."" said Army chief of staff General Moshe Yaalon. ""Political pressure certainly has potential, just as it worked on Libya. And this must be exhausted first of all, in my view.""   Is there any way for Bush to classify them as terrorists? Afterall some al-Qaeda members have been allowed to pass through. According to resent inspections there is some evidence of a nuclear weapons program that could be used against Iran.  Iran has denied that they have any nuclear weapons programs and that their program is strictly for energy research only. They said they signed the NPT and would allow UN inspectors in as they have signed for that as well. Afterall Israel has not signed the NPT so I don't know what they're complaining about.  Now here's the way I see it. Israel and the US will push for more UN inspections. I don't think Bush could do the same thing he did in Iraq which was accusations without anything backing it up, even if he did declare it a terrorist regime. Iran is not on the 'Coalition of the Willing' list which puts them in a unfavorable light in Bush's eyes. Afterall if they're not with us, they're against us, or something to that affect. The trick will be to keep the hard liners in check. Should they take control it may cause Iranians to flock to their country in a patriotic surge, similar to what happened in the US after 9/11, and back any actions they may deem appropriate, again such as 9/11.   Here's some additional information on the evidence that has been gathered:   urlLink http://www.cfr.org/background/iran_curtail.php"	m
Beyond Help  Something kind of strange happened last night so of course I had to write about it.  Actually, yesterday was strange in lots of ways.  But nevermind all that.  What I want to write about is how hopeless I think it may be for the DBD now.    I finally decided to clear away any and all feelings of hurt, anger, jealousy and whatever else may be lurking about in my mental garden regarding him.  I then said a little prayer for him and lit an incense to carry my wishes upward.  Do you believe that the incense wouldn't light... and once it did light, it just fizzled out.  It wouldn't burn.  I took it as a sign that even though I've forgiven him, he has some work of his own to do.  So, I asked the incense to bless my work instead.  It burnt for over an hour.  Go figure.  Diva out.	f
Yesterday night we played Saint Edmonds in Junior Varsity action. Saint Edmonds is an over cocky catholic school in Fort Dodge. They all think that they are pretty bad news bears, but in all actuality they SUCK! At the end of the half its like 14-0 and we are behind and getting our butts chewed out. Late in the game we made a surge to tie it at 20 points all, with about 1:30 to go, but our plans backfired as an interception spelled definate doom.  Me personally, I didn't do too bad. But there is always room for improvement. My blocking could have been quite a bit better, I probably should have had about 3 or 4 missed tackles, etc. etc. There are also some people on my team that I dont think are giving it their 100%. And one is probably...no no no...the one person that I am aiming at is BRYAN GOTTULA...but what do I know...I only play football with all of my heart and all of my soul trying to do my personal best on every down of every game...I mean its not like I can slack off or anything....like some people...  Chew on that for a while!!!	m

"Sunday  Today   I stayed up too damn late cleaning my room and watching TV on Saturday night, until sometime after 5am, then I slept off and on for a few hours on the couch Sunday morning because my bed was too cluttered to use. I felt tired and sore all day Sunday. We were going to go to Goodwill on Sunday, and I had planned to go to the Steve Winwood concert Sunday night, but I felt so crappy, I really didn't feel like going anywhere anyway. I worked in my room off and on, did some laundry, but mostly I sat in front of the computer or in front of the television (pretty good ""Sopranos"" this week, but next week's looks even better), basically resting my back. I was in bed (my own, I cleared it off) before 10:30pm.   I had trouble sleeping at first, but I woke up feeling like I'd actually had a good night's sleep, so that's cool. What wasn't cool was that it was storming out and I had to wait for the bus in the rain. I would've gotten soaked at my normal stop (especially from trucks passing by, splashing me), so I walked down the road to a sheltered one, but it wasn't much better (the bench was drenched and rain was splashing on me underneath it). I punched in at 9:36am (I took my time getting ready this morning), late, and a bit soggy to boot.  I have a lot of work to do in my room still. I have piles of clothes, musical equipment, sheet music, and various other stuff, sitting in the middle of my floor and I have to find a place for everything, which won't be easy since I moved my desk out. I need more storage space now, or else I need to get rid of some stuff. Grrrrrr!!!!!"	m

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine, Maybe even nine and a half in four beers time, That blue top shop top you've got on is nice, Bit too much fake tan though, but, yeah you score high.  But there's just one little thing that's just really really really annoying me about you, you see, Yeah yeah, like I said, you are really fit, But my gosh! Don't you just know it?  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?  So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard, I was waiting in the queue looking at the board, Wondering whether to have a burger or chips, Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford, When I noticed out of the corner of my eye, Looking toward my direction your eyes locked on my course, I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order, Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?  Whoah Leave it out Are you smoking something? Leave it out Mike, just leave it We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment It's not worth it, Mike Leave it out, Just leave it Don't touch me Don't touch me, I'm alright  For a while there, I was thinking, yeah but what if..? Picturing myself pulling with bare white hearted wit, Staring at you standing there opposite, Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick, And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queueing was clocking onto you to it, I had to admit that yeah, yeah, you are fit and I do want it, But I stopped sharking a minute to get chips and drinks.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?   Oi, just as you started to make your big advance, With the milkshake and that little dohnut in hand, I was like, nah, I can't even, no you look grand, But you looked sharp there, smiling hard suggesting, and, Leaning away with your hearty hearty looking tan, But I admit the next bit was spanners to my plan, You walked toward my path but just brushed right past, And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?   What do I give a fuck, I've got a girlfriend anyway, Oi, we're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play, I've got this stella I bombed from that last cafe, This night's not even begun, Yes, yes, oh yay.   I did fancy you a bit though, yeah I must say, I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display, But this is just another case of female stopping play,  In an otherswise total result of a holiday.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?    God BLESS Mike Skinner!	f
Well just another hectic Monday.        Yesterday Boyfriend's truck broke down, I guess the engine blew out.  Now I'll be  taking him to work at 7 am every day until he gets it fixed.  Which will be a couple of weeks.      Its hotter than hell in my house.  Last night I almost went outside to sleep.        Oh yeah, and my refrigerator broke.  So all of my soda's are warm.  YUM!	f
"current mood:  headache, so shut the hell up  currently listening to:  my life slipping away  This just for fun because I ran out of shit to say.     Two men are sitting in a bar talking. One is a train conductor. He says, ""I'm so embarrassed. Today I was on the train, and I was collecting tickets for Pittsville. I see this hot blonde, and instead of saying 'Now collecting all tickets to Pittsville' I said 'Now collecting all pricks to titsville.'""  The other man says, ""You know, something like that happened to me too recently. I came home from work and my wife was upset, my supper was burned, the house was a mess. And instead of saying to my wife, 'Why is my supper burned, and the house a mess?' I said, 'You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.'""     I mentioned in an earlier post that I dated just a little before meeting Joanne (who ironically had ferrets just like my last 2 other girlfriends, what's up with that?) but there is one date I had mentioned to Joanne that she ""enjoyed"" so I thought I would share it with you guys along with this run-on sentence.  You see, I sort-of like to cook and by ""sort-of"" I mean ""if it gets me laid"". Well I was making my world class fajitas (fresh out of the box mind you, just like my wine) at my apartment when I helped my date to her chair and served her plate like the gentleman I pretended to be. I sat down to eat and tried to strike up a conversation about ferrets or something but she just sat there quietly and barely touched her food. This got me a little peeved but I tried not to show it but it didn't take long before I started to get a bit irate. We ended up getting into a heated debate about what's considered proper dating etiquette which surprisingly enough, I was losing! I finally had enough of this so I deflated her and put her back in the closet. Worst $50 I ever spent."	m

"http://cicadaville.com/ - these are cicadas gone wrong. all wrong.  So, Christopher, the homeless man who I give change to every morning admitted to me that he spent the money I gave him on booze. He promised to me that he would get on the wagon and sober up. So, I've been offering to buy him juice or water, but he'd rather have the change. It's understandable, he may need new socks or cigarettes, but I just hope he doesn't fall back off the dreaded wagon again. When I was at the 2000 New Year's Phish show in Florida, people brought this boat that they hauled around behind their truck. They drove all around the parking lots and camp grounds picking up party people. It was classic. We'd be hanging out round our hibachi, which later got stolen by hibachi thieves, and we'd hear the party boat coming up, people yelling, ""Get on the party boat!."" By the early morning, people where hanging over the sides half sea sick and hung over, but the spirit was still there. The party boat lives on. Anyways, the point of my story is that, it shouldn't be just getting back on the wagon...but rather getting on the party boat. Even if it is the sober party boat, it will still be a great ride."	f
"I agree with you Natalya. The ending of ""The Great Gatsby"" left me hanging also. I feel like I missed some hidden messages or themes. Mr. Selby, my ASL teacher, said he loved the book and that it made such an impact on him... Yeah, I think I'm missing something. I liked Fitzgerald's imagery throughout the book. It was really amazing. There were some very beautiful passages. I need to do some discussing with my group."	f
Great (and funny)  urlLink review of  King Arthur  !    I was mildly interested in seeing it, but don't think I will now.  Even with the boiled-leather...yeah.  Why does Keira Knightley like to play in movies with extremely dubious historical plots?	m
urlLink    Here is the manmade lake I was talking about, and wooded area yonder (in the background ..) kinda creepy at night ..  urlLink	f
I just noticed, it takes me half a day to read all the blogs in my links... That's a great way to spend a working day.  Happy Weekend every one!	f

"Looking Ahead Backwards    Long road trips are often filled with spells of grogginess, dissociation and intense impatience. Travelling as fast as you can with a single destination in mind and knowing that the end of your trip is still several hours away can flood you with a restless feeling, a dissatisfaction that erases any sense of the progress you've made ... as you whiz by other cars at almost a hundred miles per hour. So a road trip is the perfect metaphor for my life right now.  On Thursday I was at the top of the world and I really felt at peace. I was focussed on the life I'll have several months from now after I get rid of all the ""debris"" from my current one. But by Friday I could feel myself getting caught up in the here and now. I knew that if I didn't get out of the apartment things would only go downhill emotionally. So on Friday night after hanging out with friends in San Francisco, I got in my car and drove to San Diego. The time that I spent with my wife last weekend was awesome. But I knew that even if we had another great weekend together it would be like throwing gasoline on the fire ... there's a part of me that's going to get hurt no matter what. I needed to put all my attention on some other part of my life and a road trip seemed perfect.   Inside Aunt Jane   I made it to San Diego in eight hours with only a tank and a half of gas and an hour of sleep at a makeshift ""rest station"" ( read: pulled over on the side of the road in the wee hours of the early morning ). The check-in time at the hostel wasn't until 2pm so I had a lot of time to kill. I got onto the trolley and took a trip to Tijuana. Does Tijuana actually mean something as a name ? What if it's some shortened form of ""Tia Juana"" that would make for a number of interesting stories since it translates as ""Aunt Jane"". For most people in the U.S. the word Tijuana is synonymous with dirt, squalor, and a tourist industry that caters to Americans looking for both. I took a taxi over to Avenida de Revolucion in order to do some shopping. I think it's mandatory that most large cities have an area dedicated to quarantining obnoxious foreigners and Revolucion is just such a place.     Made In Mexico, Poorly But With Great Pride    But I actually had a fun time shopping. One of the annoying things about Spain is that after about two hours of ""tourista shopping"" you had a complete inventory of all the items that you're likely to find in such shops across Spain. There are the leather items and metal work from Toledo, the fans from Seville, the gold filigree work from Granada. And all the little shops are buying from the same suppliers in China. This is the real miracle of outsourcing: everything everywhere looks like everything else. But Tijuana is different.    Obscene Shopping Fun   Part of the reason is that Mexicans are selling crap that's so bad, the items couldn't even find their way into a street stand in Madrid. Everyone is familiar with American kitsch, right ? Well rural Mexicans certainly are and when you combine that with some mediocre paper mache skills and a keen interest in an American buck ... you have a recipe for obscene shopping fun. Some of my personal favorites include the very poorly made life size reproductions of Spider Man, Bat Man, and miraculously the Green Lantern. Or the vendors with burros painted with prison stripes so that American tourists could take pictures of themselves ""in Tijuana"". I'm pretty sure that with a polaroid camera and a Mexican flag, I could make an outrageous fortune by charging drunk tourists for the opportunity to take pictures of themselves peeing on the pride of Mexico.  Now don't get me wrong. There were a handful of rather nice shops including one that sold reproductions of well known Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec artifacts. There was also another shop that sold things with a ""Day of the Dead"" theme. I distinctly remember one rather nice skeleton puppet: it was bright white and had a giant pink penis. I'd like to think that this was the artist's way of saying that in the end we're all fucked by death. If so, the statement was wasted on the marines from Camp Pendleton who actually bought it. I focussed on shopping for that soon to be light of my life, Zoe. I bought two slightly ridiculous dresses that probably won't fit her for five years and I called it a day. One was a little flamenco dancer outfit and when I returned home, I realized that the skirt portion was attached to the dress by eight extremely large, sharp pins. Perfect for a small toddler ...   I Worship Ochango   The trip back was living hell. It took forty-five minutes to get through customs and the trolley to San Diego was packed. I did have one interesting experience though. A young Mexican-American asked me if I had accepted Jesus Christ as my saviour. What does one say to that ? It happens all the time but I'm never ready for it. And I'm rotten at improv. I thought very hard very quickly and responded with ""Who ?"". I then explained in two or three-word sentences with the worst fake Dutch accent I could muster that I was from South Africa. The kid asked me if there were churches in South Africa and I told him that we only had temples. So who do you worship ? Ochango ! He seemed very confused and proceeded to ask six or seven more questions about South Africa, ending in a ""I thought everyone there was black"" ( with a disturbing little snicker at the end ). The only other high point in the conversation was when I asked him if he had children. He was only sixteen and looked at me with a slightly horrified expression. He shook his head then asked me the same. I told him that I had six children. His response said alot ... ""Ohhh, the cost of living must be very cheap there."" Smart kid.   Underneath The Thin Veneer of Grime Is More Of Same   I returned to the hostel and proceeded to sleep until about 6pm. I woke up just as some kid was checking into my dormitory style room. He looked about 22 years old and the first thing he did was pin up a giant poster of his girlfriend on the only available patch of wall space. As I think about it now, the poster was in direct view of his bed so maybe he had put it up for reasons that weren't purely sentimental. I showered and immediately headed back to Tijuana. My experience of the city was entirely different by evening. Side streets that had been deserted in the morning were now jam packed with natives out for their afternoon stroll. This was when I really began to love the city. I had more fun people watching in five minutes than I usually have in a week in San Francisco. A scam is taking place on every street corner. Look to the right, there's an old man who just shouted something to a group of teenage girls that would have gotten him arrested in California. Look to the left, there's a woman dressed like a whore and she just handed her baby to some guy. I'm pretty sure the last thing she said was ""trabajo en calle"" and then she blew him a kiss.   Tijuana is one giant seamy underside without censor or pretense. Best of all you can walk one block away from a tourist trap and not see a single gringo for hours. Sure most of it is shabby and there are a couple of streets that made me want to pee in my pants out of sheer fear. But it's actually one of Mexico's richest urban centers and over a hundred thousand people call it home.    Mexico: Where The Boundaries Blur   I was amazed by the number of children out with their parents. People seemed surrounded by kids like flies. Every woman that I saw in their mid-20s had two or three children in tow. And each little shop seemed to double as an alternative day care center. It seemed like the wall that separates personal life from work is very thin for most people in Mexico and after working at a huge lab for seven years I'm drooling with envy. I spent atleast two hours soaking up the city and it's sights. Finally starved out of my wits, I broke down and got a taco from a street vendor. I handed him a dollar which he promptly put in his pocket and then with the same bare hand he scooped up a handful of chicken and a grilled tortilla. He wiped his hands on his apron when he was done. This vendor hadn't been burdened by invisible things called ""germs"" so why should I ? I ate my taco with gusto.     When The Angels Are Deaf, People Shout The Loudest   After so much walking I needed a place to sit down. Right next to the taco stand was a church and it seemed packed for Saturday mass. In America popular religion was dealt a death blow by television but here in Tijuana it still seems to be going strong. I didn't really understand a lot of what was going on and the church was particularly odd. The walls were either falling apart or not entirely finished yet and as a result the acoustics were horrible. The priest was reciting mass but I don't think communion was being offered. In the back of the church a group of old women were weeping. And there was a side alter jam packed with people clamoring to place votive candles on a shrine. It was a strange slightly mysterious place to me. After twenty minutes everyone in the pews crossed themselves, and then got up and left so I did the same.    The Tijuana Dive Bar Experience   After properly sanctifying myself, it was time to hit the bars and I saw several guys who had been in the church do the same. After talking with a taxi driver, I found myself in this little hole in the wall that made most so called American dive bars look like hi-brow drinking establishments. I walked in and was seated at a dingy little table with four chairs. The table got the mandatory wipe down with a rag that looked like it had seen better days four or five years ago and I ordered a Tecate. There were only five or six people in the place. I settled down with my beer and waited for something to happen. Vendors came by and I had one of the best churros I'd had in a long time. Almost as good as the ones in Spain. It took an hour before the bar got really packed. By that time my table had three other guys only two of whom actually seemed to know each other. I said hi and bought a round of drinks.  Everyone was really very friendly and we shot the shit for a couple of hours. I got lucky because one of the people at my table spoke English well. We made jokes about the tourists, and I asked them questions about the city. I noticed that almost everyone in the place was a guy. I couldn't help asking what was up. My translator smiled and said that in his case his wife was ""working"" over at a little bar in the red light district and that he'd be happy to get me a deal if I wanted it. Wow, I thought. These people sure are friendly ... I smiled and told him that I was already too drunk to take him up on his offer.    Is That A Part Of Mexico ?   I asked them about other places to check out and that essentially kick started a night of bar hopping and extreme drinking accompanied by my translator / wingman / would-be-pimp. I remember snippets of conversation that I had here and there throughout the night. I've been interested in travelling to Tabasco state and I asked several people about it. They all looked at me with a perplexed expression and said they hadn't been there and didn't know anyone who had. Well, that's what the people who knew it was a state in Mexico did. The others just smiled and looked at me with an expression that said, ""What the fuck are you talking about ?"". I also remember buying several rounds of  drinks. But at about 2am I had to leave in order to catch the last trolley back to San Diego. I seriously considered staying until the first trolley of Sunday morning but I was pretty smashed so I did the wise thing and went home. I guess next time I should just get a hotel room in Tijuana. It would actually be cheaper than my stay at the hostel.   In any case, I fell asleep on the trolley and had to walk from the end of the line to the Gas Lamp district. For all effective purposes my road trip was over. The ride home was uneventful and long. If there was any where I'd like to go on a second road trip it would be White Horse in the Yukon Territory ... but we'll see."	m
Well, mainly because I'm jealous of Glen, I'm making up my own awards to give out, just this one time. (AKA Not Weekly)  One will be for pitchers: the Mr. Effective Award -- the pitchers who use the least amount of baseballs thrown for the longest amounts of innings, for the best possible results.  The other? Not pitchers, but.... anyone? anyone? Batters. -- the award for batters given out by me will be the Mr. Production Award -- the batters who get on base, score runs, and get around the diamond. A poor man's award resembling Bill James' RC (runs created) stat.  To get the Candidates for the Mr. Effective Award, I take the Top 10 lists for P/IP, K/9, K/BB, and WHIP -- anyone listed on two of these gets looked at and the list is honed down into 3 Candidates.  The Long List: -D. Wells, SD -G. Maddux, CHC -M. Mulder, OAK -O. Perez, LA -B. Sheets, MIL -R. Johnson, ARI -J. Santana, MIN -J. Vazquez, NYY -J. Schmidt, SF   The Candidates: (1) Ben Sheets, MIL 2.58 ERA, 0.91 WHIP, 15.20 P/IP, 6.28 K/BB, 9.39 K/9  (2) Randy Johnson, ARI 3.04 ERA, 0.88 WHIP, 15.00 P/IP, 5.16 K/BB, 10.07 K/9  (3) David Wells, SD 3.25 ERA, 1.04 WHIP, 13.84 P/IP, 3.67 K/BB, 3.58 K/9   Mr. Effective Award Winner: Ben Sheets -- Although Johnson gave Sheets a run for his money, in the end, it all comes down to how many runs you give up. Johnson's WHIP is amazing, but so is Sheets'. The pitches per inning are comparable between the two. The Ks per Walks lean to Sheets. And Johnson does get some revenge in Ks per game. Overall, though, Ben Sheets is Mr. Effective.   The Mr. Production Award isn't so scientific. Mainly, becuase I don't have that kind of time. So here's how I did it: I perused through SB stats, Batting stats, and all others that don't really count (RBIs, etc) and if I saw a name pop up several times, I nominate them. Hooray for simplicity.  The Long List: -A. Rodriquez -B. Bonds -C. Beltran -A. Pujols -V. Guerrero -M. Mora -J. Thome  The Nominees for Mr. Production (along with whatever categories they are Top 5 in the league with)  (1) A. Rodriquez .376 Batting Avg., 108 Hits  (2) B. Bonds .353 Batting Avg., 22 HR, 63 Runs, .798 Slg. Percent.  (3) V. Guerrero 67 Runs, 107 Hits, 67 RBIs  The winner of the Mr. Production Award: Barry Bonds. Not really even a close race either. Really, his OBP or OPS alone are enough to win, and the IBBs he gets are about as numberous as the vowels in this blog entry. The production he adds to the Giants line-up gives them all the freedom in the world to simply use money for defense and pitching. Bonds is, by far, the biggest reason the Gaints are in first place (Schmidt would be added in the acclaim, but he plays 20% of the games, whereas Bonds plays 95%). Quite simply, Bonds is Mr. Production. Mr. Baseball, maybe, too.	m

good things come in small packages....   i was feeling quite lithe in my new pair of black overall pants last week when it hit me -  i am complete .  oh no, this isn't a deep, soul-searching entry... not at all.  it's just that i was hit with one of those rare moments where i feel that i - standing  4-feet-11-and-a-half-inches  - am an a-ok person.  everything that anyone could want fits neatly into this little frame.  if i was less lazy, i'd be physically strong.  what i am capable of learning and feeling and experiencing, knocks me over.  particularly since i'm so short.  doesn't taking up 5-feet-6-inches (and the ensuing width and depth) of space seem like such a waste now?  but you know what?  i would have had to journey down the dark side and consider that wouldn't it be awesome to be this complete and, like, 20 lbs. lighter?  it's like packing the same punch with a smaller package... like  ultra tide .  this is my motivation.  ultra tide.  (this comes on the heels of gaining two pounds since the beginning of this month.  that is depressingly bad, i might add, because (1) it's a larger proportion for me than it is for most of you and (2) i wear kinda fitted clothes so a pound - and especially two! - changes everything.)     urlLink read more....	f

"Why I Don't Need to Drink   Dear Last Night, (stealing a page from the lovely  urlLink Kristin's  book)  I was so bored and frustrated with you that I spent forever messing with a printer and $40 worth of ink cartridges without being able to coax a printed page from that crap-ass Canon bubble jet I purchased in North Carolina that I ate too many M and instantly felt guilty. I hate that I sound like Bridget Jones, but I'll get over that comparison and forge ahead.   So, I was staring at you, looking at the clock and my computer, with the stories whose words I couldn't tear up with my blue Precise ink pens and then rearrange and revise until exhaustion or narcolepsy took over. I called Jan back to tell her how much you sucked; she said come on over, she could fix that. I asked her if I should bring her the fixings for Shirley Temples, we bad girls we, and she said, pshaw, I already have the grenadine and 7Up and cherries, get your tookus over here.   With that, dear night, you became infinitely more laid back and more party. Less frustrated rut, more let's read Tarot cards and drink too many margaritas and order pizza with Canadian bacon and tomatoes. You exposed me to ""Reno 911."" I laughed so hard I fell backwards, stared at the ceiling and continued to crack up. Sometimes, on nights like these, I miss cable TV.   All I remember, after Reno 911 is that I asked Jan if I could spend the night. She said yes and gave me a pillow and a blanket and didn't tell me there was pizza on my hot pink t-shirt. She gave me a contact lense carrier and saline solution and laughed at her inebriated friend who is supposedly going to teach at an all-women's college and LOVE it. That Devil card kept coming up in my readings. Jan said it meant sex, I'm not so sure.   Plus, Jan's been dabbling in the occult since, well, forever. But she's a harmless good-girl Catholic. You can't put too much stock in those kind of things, right?   I woke up this morning, wishing I hadn't been so gluttonous. That temperance card should've come up more often. But Last Night, you weren't so bad. I had fun, laughing, dreaming and watching  Zoolander  and ""eugoogle-lizing"" my life with Tarot Cards and tequila's-already-in-it! margaritas. Thank you, now try to tell Today that she needs to help me fix that stupid printer.  Much love,  Kella"	f
The company(VanguardMS) is getting clear to shuting down itself, while the effort of pursuing a buyer is going dim, it has no other choice. Having been working on the same company for 5 years, it is not a short time for me, it is almost half of my career so far, and I love the work I was doing, ie. the network protocol development is kind of fun as well as challenge for me. Looking to the future, I don't know if I can get the same fun out of the job, anyway, the money to support the life is more important. During the 5 years, even it maybe only a short time from some points of view, the company has been changed a lot, from Motorola to VanguardMS, with different style of company cultures, you can feel the different bettween working for a big company and a middle(or small) size company, during these years, you can also feel the big changes in the IT field, and the global econocial changes, people are talking about IT jobs outsourcing, the outlook is pretty dim for IT worker in America like us. Anyway, this is a change in my life, maybe it is even a chance for me, or maybe I am just too much optimistic and should keep in mind the tough life waiting for me?	m
I can't wait for the table tennis match this afternoon. Will Singapore's representative, Li Jiawei win? I really wonder. Anyway, I hope that she does because, it's going to be of great significant to us. But nevertheless, she has done a great job and has done all the Singaporeans proud of her. Way to go! I was looking at her on tv yesterday and I realised jing fang was right. She really is indeed wearing alot of accessories, the ear rings, the necklace and the ring. I suspect the ring is her engagement ring. Wow. And the TV like purposely zoomed in to her precious ring. I wonder how much it costs, with all the shining and all that. Actually, it's hard for a sportsman to be so feminine. Don't you think so? Look at the others. They don't wear all these fancy stuff on their body. And they look so boyish. Not like girls at all. So, I envy her for being so sporty yet still so feminine. Double-sided. That's cool. =) Anyway, I hope she will win a medal for Singapore. We'll always be behind you.	f

"So I think that I am convinced that there is some strange time thing that exists and it makes Saturday and Sunday go by in double time. I swear it was just Friday but here I am monday morning back at work. Oh well. It just almost became worth it though because someone just came and dropped us off bagels and although I am much more an english muffin type girl, Einstein Brothers has the best cranberry bagels.    I had this small epiphany this weekend. I live in very very Northeastern Ohio, and  I had to attend this wedding is very very Southern Ohio.  And I now know why most people think of backwoods, farms and corn when they think of Ohio. Wow there was like nothing and the wedding reception was at this ""Country Club"" yeah it was like a barn, and at the reception there were actually people wearing jeans and cammo and little boys taking their shirts off and running around. it was only like a few hours away from where I live but wow it was totally like another world. Amazing to me. I am so a city girl, like even Cleveland isn't really big enough for me but did I appreciate it soo much more after this weekend. I am also estatic because they are announcing today at 1:00pm where, and when Farm Aid will take place and also who is playing. If you don't know what Farm Aid is, it is a concert that is put on every year and all the proceeds go to independent farmers throughout the country. Willie Nelson, Dave Matthews, Neil Young and John Mellencamp are all like ""board of directors"" or whatever and orchestrate the whol;e thing. Willie nelson started it I think back in like 1989. It is always a great time and is for a great cause. Ok well there is my randon tangent filled blog for Monday."	f

A Pisces would often rather leave financial matters up to others; their mind is in a different place. Don't reproach a Pisces too harshly for being a daydreamer instead of a doer. The Fish are known for being in tune with the spiritual, not the material. Never knock old-fashioned, hearts-and-flowers true love.

A Pisces might not yell or throw things when they get hurt, but they feel it very deeply all the same. Never treat your Pisces too casually; don't toy with them or let them see you play the field. A Pisces does not like this behavior, as it goes against their ideas about true love and spiritual connection. Do not subjugate their artistic impulses -- this is a truly creative Sign, and you may be standing in the way of their happiness and a fine piece of art.	f

Would the world be a better place if we shot all useless and moronic people?  Would we be happier with a smaller population, more focus on individual achievement, art, and science? Or am I delusional and subconsciously violent toward those whom cannot benefit me, themselves, or others even though they seem to have a normal IQ?	m
So anyway I was going to do some serious blogging last night, until  urlLink this  little bastrad sucked up about an hour and a half of my blogging time.  Remember to just say no. If you don't ever start, you won't ever have to quit.	m
Oh, and by the way, i went to Helen's book and cake sale today; it was quite fun and we sold all the cookies (yay!). But did you know, Gracie, that Joe still flirts? I thought after his chance went at Viney Hill he'd just take no notice of me any more - but he still seems to come and stand close and hint when he talks and stuff. And talks about completely random stuff just for something to talk about. He told me about how they have a river at the bottom of their garden, and a guy lost his shoe into it and the shoe has probably floated up to Cirencester or something by now. You gotta admit, guys can be pretty sweet sometimes! I know i  always  say that guys are sweet, but sometimes they sooo are!!! Like when they wave at you. That's really sweet.  (hee hee, goes off into little dreams about guys)	f
It seems to be that it might become more of a challenge for me to access my journal for my computer will be unplugged till school starts, however I will still try and write to it from work when the occasion arises.  Reason being is that Adam and I have now moved to what is pretty much in the Bronx.  To give you an idea of location, we are close to 215th street.  Grand Central and Time Square is at 42nd street.  So about a 170 blocks away from midtown.  We are on the first floor of an apartment building next to a park.  A co worker of mine has a friend who is going to S. America for business and pleasure and was looking for someone to sublease.  Unable to do so, we were offered the place rent free (do have to pay for utilities) as long as we take care of her two cats.  The place isn't the greatest, but it's not bad either.  There is an A/C in the bedroom and cable TV which is a plus.  I'd have to say the worst thing though is the cat hair.  We have made the bedroom cat free and make sure the door is always closed.  Still, I'm sure it will end up on everything.    However saving a 1000 dollars seems to outweigh the cost.  Saturday was the day we left, we ate dinner at the same place we ate when we had arrived.  Good ol Doubledays, its pretty good.  Sunday after sleeping in, I went to the city looking for a birthday gift for Elle.  I didn't have that much luck, plus I really don't care to shop.  That was pretty much the extent of the day.  While even though we are now closer to the city, it still takes about the same time to get to work.  I now ride the subway, and have to only switch once.  A train to the 7.  Let me tell you what, it gets hot in those subways.  Luckily the cars themselves are air conditioned.  Alright well I need to go FedEx some advertisements that promote cancer and mouth disease.  My favorite part of the day.	m
Hi guys......... gals,      Seems maths assignment and extra classes r taking there toll. bcoz there is no new blog here since 12 August....not even a copy pest operation ;-).      by the way last week was full of happenings with thanxgiving party , i- day celebrations and than quiz on 17th .It was a miracle that Prof. CVRS postponed his assignment due date  i had some relief.but there r assigments lined up for the next week EM , BCDH, QT etc. to mention a few.But as usual, everything will be completed by last date.      Seniors had the best of last week with winning everything they participated in  i think we must have a dope test fron next time onwards.      Also i danced on stage for the first time in my life.And the poem 'NEEND' was praised by many.       Also 'Indra Dev' were at their best during full week with not even a single day sparing with rains  it was really enjoyable to watch n hoot for Football match in rain on I-day.      rain also showed its magic in my home state Rajasthan where till 15 days ago Govt. was planning for Drought Relief and now they have to plan for Flood relief(It happens only in India).      by now the postponed date of QT assigment is again approaching and i think i should leave n prepare for that.

Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some odd reason, and it was making me mad. Man, I feel so sick. My tummy really really hurts. :( Stupud guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.   So, today was an ok day. Only 4 more days of actual class. Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and actually worked on my speech outline. I was amazed, I actually did work. Then, music theory, gosh, I want to get away from that class SO SO SO much. Seriously. Yuck. Oh well. He just talked, and talked, and talked, and blah bah blah!!!!! Argh. It seriously didn't end. Chemistry was ok. We just got a ton of really confusing notes. Argh. Poo on Mr. K. Sometimes he's ok, but sometimes I just want to choke him. RAR! Ummm, Health was ok. Really boring and pointless. Busy work. Grr. We wrote stories with 15-25 words we found in the chapter. It was really very pointless. Speech was ok. I didn't have to give my speech. Someone else gave a speech on Plastic Surgery though so...yikes. Oh well. Umm, lunch was ok. Math was boring. I think I actually understood what we were doing though. Government, we just watched 12 Angry Men.  It was really a pretty boring day, and I think I'll go work on my speech now so I can go eat dinner and go read, and then go to sleep early. Wow, that would be nice. OK, Byebye.	f
Bit of a nothing day today. I finally crashed at around 8 o'clock this morning and then slept through until nearly 4pm, neatly killing my plans to go job hunting.  Having written off the productive part of my day, I figured I could at least get down to some serious internet time-wasting. To that end I've added a guestbook and a counter to the page using  urlLink Bravenet . It's all looking a bit cheap and cheesy, but it's the best I can do at the moment, especially given that I don't have ANY skills in the HTML department. I am picking things up, but it's a slow process.  So, yeah. Do me a favour and  urlLink SIGN  the damn guestbook. And go look at the counter. It's at the bottom of the page. Exciting, eh?  Indeed.  I received my copy of Bruce Campbell's autobiography from  urlLink Amazon  today. Of course, I immediately abandoned all other reading projects and dived in. Great so far. Campbell makes for a fanastic guide through his own life and career, and the various anecdotes and insider stuff will definitely give you plenty to chew on if you're a fan. Recommended so far, and I'll try to post a full review when I'm done.  The book was the second suspicious-looking package to arrive on my doorstep in as many days, although it wasn't quite as alarming as the huge box that the postman left outside yesterday, which definitely puzzled my parents, especially seeing as it was addressed to Word Boy.  This could only have been the work of the nefarious Juanita, who is one of only two people I know who would go to the trouble of posting cultural oddities halfway across the world. In this case, the item in question was an  ALF  doll, which I'll treasure forever. Cheers, Juan.  That'll do for now. I'll be back later, with...um...something. Until then, look for more strange and crap-looking gimcracks to appear on the site.  Yay!	m

Life is rough, thus i have to be tough, tears are worthless, a sign of weakness In order to protect myself, i have to arm myself with heavey armors, and stone helmets  Where am I? Who am I? These days has been cruel, I havsn't been able to show my feelings to anyone in the longest time.  I feel all my friends are so far away from me, no one understands me, what's the point of showing the real me, it'll only ruin their happy days.  Friends say they are always there, up and downs, happy or sad. but who really wants to know other people's problems? Everyone got their own to deal with. The world is frustrating, not for me, but for all of us. In the end, we are all worn out, without a vision, without any hopes The armors gets heavier every moment you live, soon no one knows who you really are, cuz you are covered up in a blob of armor which you called protection..  i find myself with many facades, the true self is a stranger even to me. who are you jack? I don' know, who am i?	m
"My friend is getting married in October.  That's really cool and all the only thing is the dude lives in England.  So she's been planning for months to go to the British Consulate in Los Angeles to get her visa.  She doesn't drive so I agreed to drive her. It would be a nifty little road trip before she moves across the freaking planet.   So I took a day off of work and drove us all the way to Los Angeles and they wouldn't give her the visa.  It was already paid for and everything!  I guess if you get the fiance visa you have to be getting married in the UK.  Apparently nobody informed her or her man of this fact. Whatever!    So our trip was wasted but we had an good time anyway(after getting over being pissed off about the visa).  We went to Venice and did a little bit of shopping. Well, as much as 2 broke people can shop.  The room we ended up staying in looked like it belonged to someone's grandma who lived on a rural farm somewhere. I made a small documentary about this fact. My first actual ""movie"",  if you can call it that. You can't but it's still funny.

"My mom surprised me this week by sending me not one, not two, but THREE seasons of Buffy on DVD. First of all, that's not cheap at all. But it's a pretty amazing gift, so a big thank-you is in order.  I now have Seasons 1-6 on DVD, which is awesome because that's pretty much the cream of the Buffy crop. Tonight I watched a couple episodes I only saw once, and the  amazing  episode ""The Body"" (from Season 4. If you're not familiar with Buffy, it's the episode where her mom dies, not from supernatural means (as is how most people on Buffy meet their untimely demise) but rather from an aneurysm. I won't go into specifics, but it's quite possibly the most moving, realistic, and well-shot hour of television that I've ever seen. There's no background music and each segment is made up of very long one-shots.  I'm lucky enough to have never lost a parent (knock on wood), but even without that experience to draw from, ""The Body"" is the saddest and most emotionally draining TV I've ever watched. And man, I watch a LOT of TV. Makes me sad that Buffy, and Angel (which never quite hit that high note), are gone."	m

urlLink Character Above All: Gerald Ford Essay  This is an excerpt from an essay about President Ford.  It is by James Cannon.  It provides a brief look at the circumstances and events that molded the president's character.   From the site:  Gerald R. Ford became President not because he was popular with the American public, not because he campaigned for the job, but because of his character.   More than any other president of this century, Ford was chosen for his integrity and trustworthiness; his peers in Congress put him in the White House because he told the truth and kept his word. He was nominated for Vice President after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign to avoid indictment for accepting bribes. Ford was confirmed by a House and Senate that expected him to replace a President who was also facing indictment for crimes......   Ford personified what Nixon was not. Ford was honest. He could be trusted. Throughout twenty-five years in the House of Representatives, Ford had proved himself to be a man of integrity. It was for that integrity that the highest powers of Congress, Democratic and Republican, chose Ford to be Vice President, knowing that Nixon's presidency was doomed......   Surely character begins at home, and in Ford's case we know for certain that it began with his mother.   Dorothy Gardner Ford was a strong and resourceful woman whose own character was tested at the age of twenty. She grew up in a warm, loving family in a small town in northern Illinois where her father prospered as a businessman and served as town mayor.   In college Dorothy met the brother of her roommate, and fell in love with him. Leslie King was the blond, blue-eyed, charming son of a wealthy Omaha banker who also owned a stage-coach line and a wool business.  On their honeymoon she discovered that she had made a tragic mistake. Her new husband struck her, not once but repeatedly. When they reached Omaha, where they were to live with his family, she found out that King was not only brutal, but a liar and a drunk. His outward charm concealed a vicious temper...	m

"""I'm So Glad I'm Not You""   is one bloggers' title for his/her weblog. I couldn't have said it better myself. I didn't get to take down the URL before I stupidly entered mine, so I'll just chalk it up to the universe telling me things. Someone check if the moon is still orbiting the earth because I'm actually listening to the cosmos today - more often than not, I ask for a second transmission.  I woke up today reminded by something  Samantha  (of S - one of the voices in my head) said in season 3:  ""It's time to start drinking heavily"" . A-MEN. Alcohol begets denial, I always say. Not my favorite defense mechanism, but it'll do in a pinch. Although it's much more fun to see your friends get wasted. The drunker the friend, the looser the lips. Hand me the camera...  In the spirit of bacchanalian delights, let's run down the list of hedonistic pleasures I've participated in the past few years. Nicotine: 4 years, then I quit cold turkey - not even tempted now. Alcohol: still do sometimes. I just don't like that my mouth tastes like a sewer afterwards. Weed: a looooong time ago. Screwed with my braincells so that ended as quickly as it began. I like my triple-digit, IQ, thank you very much.  ** Lucky Manzano doing MYX. Someone tell this  child  that commentators on TV are supposed to say words, not eat them.

So I was thinking about all the friends I've had throughout my life... And I suddenly realized that all my really good friends have one thing in common.  Now, as for really good friends, I only have a handful, 4 maybe 5 but those are the only relationships that have lasted longer than 3 years.  And the common thread is that 4 of those relationships have endured long periods of non-communication between my friends and me.  My four friends are Jennifer, Chad, Emily and MaryBeth.  I've known Chad and Jen the longest, 14 years now.  Next comes Mary, we met freshman year in high school, 12 years ago.  And, finally Emily.  Em was one of my supervisors at my first post-high school job 7 years ago.  As for those long peiods of non-communication, the longest is about 10 years.  That was Jen.  The first 4 years was because I moved to Oklahoma for high school, the next 4 years was because she moved to Oklahoma to go to college, of course, I had already moved back to California by then, and the last 2 years was because I went through a anti-church phase.  But once I came to my senses, we mended our friendship and in the last 2 years, she has become my very best friend, a place I am sure she will keep for the rest of our lives.  Now for Mary...  This story is the most hysterical by far.  Like I said, we met freshman year in high school.  She is the only friend from Oklahoma that I chose to remain in contact with.  We have multiple periods of non-communication.  The first started less than a year into our friendship and lasted about 18 months.  Neither of us remember why or how but we do remember how it stopped.  That was the second day of our junior year, when we realized that there was no possible way to make it through the school year without being friends especially since we were in 5 out 7 classes together.  On that day, it was as if the past 18 months hadn't even existed.  The second period was three years after I had returned to California.  My grandfather had become ill and subsequently passed away.  Out of grief, I had to stop talking to Mary because she reminded me of the four years I spent so close to Gramps.  I don't remember how that one ended, I think Mary found me online about a year later.  Next would be Chad, we remained in contact through the 4 years I spent in Oklahoma and even through the years of my rebellion.  I chose to not talk to him after he asked me out when I was 19.  That lasted about 2 years.  Needless to say, we never dated, and that is probably why we have remained friends for so many years.  Last but not least, Emily.  She moved away fron southern California and I got busy with trying to live the wild life.  We spent about 2 years apart.  When I finally grew up I reached out to her.  She is my oldest friend, somewhere around 10 years my senior, but that has never made a difference in our friendship, well, not after I finally turned 21 anyway.  Now we have more in common than before, both divorced moms, but she doesn't know that yet.  The point of all this is for someone to see that friendships can remain strong even if the friends don't, or can't, remain in contact.  The promises will be kept.  The bonds of a friendship will not be broken...  Time passes by so much more quickly than you expect it to.  And eventually, you can look back and see this as a great learning experience, a time of growth.  143 4ever!!!  :) SMILE :)	f
Every death feels a little bit like you're living in a snowglobe.  The snow is nice and settled and then something comes along and shakes it all up.  The more it is shaken the longer the snow takes to settle.  And the pieces never fall in the same place again.  I learn something new and change a little bit more every time someone dies.  Yesterday, standing in the church looking over the sea of family I found some peace.  Later on the way back from the movies with  urlLink serp , I realised why I remain, as  urlLink Shrike  once put it, relentlessly cheerful.  Cheerful dispositions get mistaken for many things, and with good reason.  Once in frustration, I asked  urlLink serp  why what has become my nature is so often met with smug cynicism and patronisation.  He pointed out that we are constantly bombarded with happy empty media, joy over washing detergent, hyperreal smiles over chocolate bars.  And children are always happy because they have not yet had those experiences that make them cautious and unhappy.  I am neither of those things.  We talked about people who were permanently unhappy with everything and who let the slightest things upset them.  We put it down to a lack of life experience, or more notably a lack of trauma!  It sounds strange.  Before my Dad died I was part of the cynical throng, the overtly serious sort of person who saw all the bad in the world, who let a look or a word ruin her day.  Even for a while after he died I remained that way - no one changes overnight and I was angry for a long time.  I wouldn't wish the knowledge I had been given from that event on anyone.  It changes your world.  It changes you until you don't know who you are in your own skin, and you have to figure it out all over again with this new information.  All those sad, angry things in your past can turn you into one of two things.  You can be a victim or a student.  I was given the choice of remaining cynical and angry, safe in my knowledge that I knew 'The Truth' or I could take the much harder path of treating every single new event individually and learning from it.    It's so easy to be cynical and angry!  It's so safe there, they become such familiar emotions - and then you get a taste of happiness which is so fleeting than when it goes away you feel as though it will never come back.  I have so many experiences in my life.  The bad ones seem to stand out sometimes.  The good ones are far more subtle, and far more likely to be taken for granted.  But I had the choice.  So I remain cheerful, not as any sort of payback to the bad, but because I know what happens in my every day life is  nothing  compared to those past bad experiences.  I have a benchmark if you will.  It's not from a lack of knowledge of experience that I'm happy most of the time.  It's from a great  depth  of knowledge and experience that tells me that it's my life now to do with as I wish.  I survived those bad experiences and now I'm graced with the knowledge that everything will be okay, even when things feel like they're not.    Nothing ever upsets me too deeply because things have been so much worse in my life that all those little annoyances, I am happy to say, make me laugh.  I am happy to have those small annoyances!  If that's as bad as my life is then I am so, so lucky.  I'm happy that I get to wake up and be alive and eat breakfast and be warm.  I'm happy that I am unrestrained and no one is mistreating me.  These past few years are the best I've ever had it and I'm so grateful.  I have so many reasons to be cheerful.  None come from stupidity or childishness, although I see now how it can be taken that way.  I have learned in my life what some don't learn in their lifetime.  I had to go to hell and back to learn it, and I still will never wish it on anyone.  But once again I've been shaken up and the snow is settling now into a new pattern; I feel like another door has been opened for me and my gratitude increases onwards.	f
"Well, in 2000 the Mechanical Beast and I saw him speak at UVA, but today I really met the guy 'n all 'n had my photo portrait with him. I was somewhat drunk too which was kind of appropriate. (Love free beer at party functions.) His kids were cool too and he said his wife got him his fancy gold necklace. It has a crucifix and the ten commandments tablets. That's for ""the boss and the rules,"" he said. But on the free beer, he said he never has any before speaking, so his ""spiritedness"" is his own. Time for bed!"	m
Agh, i am so tired. i would appear to have cought something of a cold, but its more likely my allergies, so they wont go away. bla. i spent all of yesterday sleeping becasue i was soooooo exhausted. and my eyes were itchy. man, what an unpleasant ailment.  boy howdy i wish i got my job. but alas, no such luck. all of a sudden my dad has started going a little bit crazy and keeps trying to get me to apply for jobs i am A) not allowed to do, or B)not qualified to do, or my favorite C) really dont want to do. AHHHH!!! why wont the damn lazer place hire me! im so good at that! i dont want to end up working at Rax!!!(for any of you who dont know, rax is the south's equivalent to an underfunded macdonalds. you can almost smell the sleaze coming off the place...and i think theyre hiring)  Meh, i wanted to talk to people las night, but i was sleeping...however, the french comment rachel left proved to be most entertaining in literal form:  my expensive, I t'aime has the insane one. you misses me much because you are the only one which could make me laugh when badly j'avais times my beautiful love, I think always has you.  hmmm...i hope thats what it really translates to, casue then french would be the best language ever. well, back to Morrowind then..oh right, i got morrowind working. badly, but i can play! haha, in your face mimimum requirements and U.S. Law! i need niether a good computer or money to play video games anymore!	m
Just curious if you saw this cartoon, or any one like it, in your hometown newspaper. I didn't think so.	m
"To Kill A Mockingbird...I have just finished reading that novel.  I finished the last chapter a few minutes ago.  That book has put so much in perspective for me.  Atticus Finch is by far the best character I have ever read about.  He had wisdom, morals, determination, love...every good quality and yet he was human at the same time.  I think that this book along with The Killer Angels are my two favorite books of all time.  Even though I do love A Separate Peace also.  A Separate Peace had a lot of the same type of themes as To Kill A Mockingbird when it comes to growing up and maturing.  Sorry if this novel talk is boring anybody.  I think it is funny that both of my favorite books have a form of the word ""kill"" in them.  Anyways, most books have themes about the evil that lives in the human heart and all that.  And I love books like that, especially the satirical types.  Like Kurt Vonnegut.  But there was something about TKAM that both revealed the evil that men could do, but also maintained that there is hope because of Atticus' undying faith in people.  At the end of the novel, even after a man tries to kill his own children, he still tells his daughter that people are nice when you get to know them.  An amazing story...wow...anyways, sorry about this boring entry.  Nothing else new has happened.  Finals are this week.  I can't get past this part on Final Fantasy X because Maester Seymour keeps casting multi spells on me that knock out two ppl at a time...how can I beat that?  This is crazy.  Gtg...bye  Lisa"	f
Woohoo!  The new site is finally up :D  Grandma is out again with her man friend and I'm stuck in here nearly as board as a cardboard box.  I'm busying myself with my website and thinking of pages and stuff I could add to it.  I'm going to upload the final part of the Holiday sections of the gallery.  I've decided to make them sections now rather than pages.  Mum is coming out of hospital tomorrow and Daniel and Ryan will be coming back from Dad's house, dear God!  I'll do some homework tomorrow and get some ingredients ready for double cooking on Monday (making a pie :D)  As for now, I'll just stay up buzzing for a while and finally drift off to bed a little later...	m
Too Much Thyme On My Hands  Last night I was making dinner. I grabbed the marjoram, noticed it had a cover for shaking, and gave it a few shakes over the dish. I grabbed the thyme, gave it a few shakes over the dish, and noticed it did  not  have a cover for shaking. Sometimes I think my spice cupboard is deliberately set up to entrap me. I retrieved what I could and scraped the rest off and threw it away. It was a terrible waste of thyme.	m

So glad to hear Mint is feeling a little better.  It is a very complicated situation with being away, being best friends with El, I'm sure her loyalties are torn and she just wants all of her loved ones around her all the time.  I feel for her.  As for your work, it really sounds like it's time to get out. There is nothing stopping you, you have the skills and more qualifications than most people I know. It's funny that you mentioned the poignant side of the Office because in series 2 I found myself feeling even more sorry for the characters especially David Brent who I thought I was incapable of feeling sorry for.  Although it seems like a dim memory now, my two and a half years at Suncorp were quite horrid and it amazes me that I stayed there all that time.  For what?  To try and prove to myself that I was a 'good worker'.  I ended up surmising that if I wasn't a good worker would that be such a terrible thing? There are so many worse things you can be.  I believe in working hard but for the right reasons. It's a worry when your own warped self-perception is your driver for doing something you hate.  Very neurotic.  My new job has been great so far but I am really struggling at the moment.  At the time my back went, there was a team reshuffle and as a result I am on a new whole new team.  The good thing is that my old manager and tech. manager are on this team too, but with being away with my back, coming in sporadically has made me feel like I'm not a part of it and that people are going to judge me by this period of my life.  Before my back happened, I was so focused, now when I'm at work it's like a whole different job, because I'm standing and uncomfortable, my concentration levels are down and I feel muddled in the head!  I'm afraid of making mistakes and losing the respect of my peers.  I told one of my supervisors how I felt and she was very understanding as she had a similar situation that went on for about 5 months and she ended up on income protection of a few weeks but I just won't be happy until I'm in the saddle again. I ended up taking the last two days off.  I can't afford it moneywise - this trip is costing us heaps - but I'm hoping that 4 days in bed will help so that I can take less medication and be more on the ball.  If I didn't have this trip I'd just get a sick note for the full 2 months recovery time but at the back of my mind is always the money. This trip is such a blessing but it seems like I really have to pay for it in other ways to actually go! And when I get really depressed I do stupid things like drink champagne with my painkillers and dance which has set me back (excuse the pun) even more.  After Wednesday, I felt like things were spiralling out of control so I took the 2 days off, have gone on the Atkins diet to try and get healthy, also means no alcohol for at least 14 days and have started gentle walking on the treadmill again.  It has made such a difference in my outlook on things and I am so keen to go back to work on Monday now that I have my positivity to keep me going.  I guess my point is that when things are shit, it is very easy to get stuck in a hole (for me, it's hard not to get self-destructive) or do nothing about it, wait for something to happen to change the situation but it feels so much better if you do something about it yourself, however small.  2003 has been such a mixed year, so much joy, so much confusion, a few obstacles.  I hope 2004 has a bit more joy and less confusion....don't mind the challenges so much, they help us to grow don't they?  DON'T THEY??!?!?  I remember Slam Dunk from ages ago, it was big in HK, you could buy the figures and pencil cases....it was huge there when I was still in high school.  I can't believe it's gone on for so long, that's like 12 years or something, didn't they have comics too, maybe that's how it started.....it must be good.  I never watched it because it was always translated to the Chinese....being the poor Cantonese speaker that I am, I need English subtitles!  I hope we can all get together on the 13th of December at the Northern Soul for a X'mas party.  I know Ninesuns and Tiger will be gone by then so we will do something with you guys before that.  We leave on the 16th of December.  I'm asking the universe with all my heart that my back has sorted itself out for the flight, I am keeping to my side of the deal by taking care of myself (no more dancing for a couple of weeks) so I reckon it will all work out.  We watched some fluff last night - Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle....all it made me do was think how good Kill Bill is (again).  Can't wait for Vol. 2.  Just think, this year Mick and I will be watching the final LOTR in the UK.  I still can't believe it's happening.  Had a dream last night that we were in Wales and I didn't pack enough stuff.  I woke up this morning and decided to start packing asap.	f
Mental Note, remind myself never to place my journal in the bank, for interesting things always happen when you're without a way to write about them.  Woke up in Plane of Knowledge Again(Thank Brell!) and was immediately greeted by my associates in battle Kretais, Katheena, Ellektra, and Akcron. After discussing things a bit, it was decided that Karnor's Castle might be the place for us to conduct battle. the Drolvarg's were a pretty mean sort of creature, looking kind of like Gnolls, only taller and stronger. So we all went. Upon arrival, Akcron got herself into trouble and promptly died. I had to resurrect her. One she had been resurrected, we went invisible, and made a mad dash for Karnor's.   One thing to note, Drolvargs have sharp senses and can see through Invisability. When we got into Karnor's there were already a few people laying waste to the Drolvarg guards. After they saw our party, they moved further in, knowing we would handle the outer defenses. After we arrived, Katheena disappeared, I still have yet to figure out where she went. I mourn her loss if she has been taken by Brell to never return.  We spent a great deal of time assualting the outside defenses, and on occassion I would bait the battlements from their posts to chase me into the throes of awaiting death. It was only toward the end that the unfortunate began to happen.  Of course we had Ellektra with us, our enchanter who has a knack for dazing enemies so they do not attack us. Well we were doing a decent job, and I eventually bait a fair group of about 3 to 5 Drolvargs, and Ellektra is doing the best she can to hold the dazing effect up so we only have to deal with one of them at a time. Unfortunate for Akcron, and for the group, there was a Beastlord, I do not remember his name, but if I did I would curse it from here to Brell. he pulled even more monsters on us. Ellektra of course using her maximum ability to keep the enemies dazed, when the beastlord starts to kick random monsters, shaking them out of their dazed states and back onto me. Both myself and Akcron die in the resulting wave of death.   I start heading back, with Akcron deftly behind me. unfortunately by the time we reached Karnor's Entrance, looking back, Akcron had gotten killed by the spiders protecting the entrance. I managed to resurrect both bodies of Akcron, and she Resurrected mine. and we attempted to continue battle. but With the Beastlord there pulling too much for himself and causing nothing but trouble to us. we decided to call it a night. Akcron gated, and I decided that I would stay behind. I setup camp in a wall of the castle. hoping not to be seen. I was successful.   If I should ever meet that beastlord again, I hope he would be prepared to battle a Paladin of Brell, for he cost my allies greatly, and nobody harms my allies and gets away with it.   If ever we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies. Ziggur Rathebringer	m

September 7, 2003  Dear Audience and Staff,  I will be going on a temporary leave (ok, a  hiatus ) so that I can get some things straightened out and in order. I will still be maintaining some things here at  Three Eye Witnesses Corporations  every now and then.  I am unsure of when I will return, but I hope that I will be back soon.  Respectfully yours,  ----- Nick Brown	m
Sunday Happenings   I slept like crap again, and got up too damn late (3pm), nothing new there.  I learned that Saddam Hussein had been captured overnight, that's good news. I just hope people don't get so caught up in their happiness that they forget how Bush  Co. lied through their teeth to the American people and distanced the USA from the rest of the civilized world just to get him.   Hussein had a crazy Ted Kazinski/Charles Manson beard working for him... nice.  Mom cooked up a killer post-Thanksgiving/pre-Christmas turkey dinner tonight, complete with stuffing, carrots, mashed potatoes, and cranbery sauce! Since I missed out on Thanksgiving dinner this year, this was a real treat for me. She even bought some pecan pie for after dinner! Mmmmm...  I talked to JP today and he liked the set list I came up with. He's going to pass it on to the other guys. Al was supposed to call me tonight (about dropping his amp), but he never did.   I still need to re-string my guitar and put new batteries in my pedal before practice on Tuesday, I want to be ready to play onstage that night. That'll actually be my first real gig with a real band (I jammed with some friends as a goof once), and only the second public performance with this band (we played a friend's Labor Day party). I think I will need a shot of Jack beforehand to ease my nerves (I'm already getting anxious about it).   I hedged about doing more auctions tonight, but I finally decided to do it. I listed about 50 new auctions. Good thing too, because my current auctions tanked. I sold a shitload of $20, $25, and $30 cards for $1 each. Where the hell were all the buyers tonight? Sheesh!   My cassette tape auctions tanked too. I sold 16 tapes, for a total of $22.75, which is horrible considering I had 58 end with no bids. The listing fees for all of these came to $22.20, but lest you think I actually made a $0.55 profit, the tapes I sold cost me about $5.60, so I lost $5.05 on them. I'm going to have to come up with some other, less costly, way of selling them.	m
Good stuff Igor.   By the way,  Three hours of doing  Dynamics, and I actually found it  fun... There are two possible explanations for my enjoying of mech problems. 1st: I liked it because I was able to insert values into the  formulas and get the answers, which made me think that I'm  smart. 2nd: I liked it because I'm psicologically unhealthy and I need  a break.  Good night	f
Imperial   Gain/loss:  -2 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 23 1/2 lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  - 908 g  Gain/loss total:  - 10.7 kg     Pretty please considering we had Ben's party this week. So that obviously meant baking and icing two more cakes as well as still eating some of the Easter chocolates. I'm happy.  New York got confirmed as well. We're definitely going. I think it's gonna be just me and Elin, but I'm pretty pleased about that. It's not gonna be November like we first planned but probably second week in October. Really looking forward to that now.  I've bought next size down on trousers, but I can't do them up, I can get them on, but that's the furthest, no where near doing them up yet. I'll take them to Finland in the summer and I'll wear them there. I promise. Oh, on the typically British note, the weather is absolutely gorgeous. Yesterday it was +20C in the shade and of course sunny. I managed to get a little red on my back, but it'll turn into tan soon.	f
"This past weekend was an interesting one to say the least, and a first in the respect that I spent both Friday and Saturday night in CT. For one I am pleased to to say that on Friday afternoon, my nuts finally dislodged themselves from my throat and I asked out that particular blonde corpsman I had mentioned in one of my previous entries, and we'll get back to her in a little bit.  I ended up meeting out with a coworker for happy hour on Friday evening. I met him out at Margarita's around 5:30 and he was accompanied by his girl friend, her cousin, and a guy who was completely deaf. The deaf guy didn't hang for very long, leaving me absolutely no cannon fodder to direct at the handicapped. Mind you as well, I was now full on engaged with the ""30 something"" crowd, which I am not accustomed to in the least, but I didn't let it hold me back at all. So we're joking laughing, sipping margaritas, and this cousin that's with them, Victoria, you can tell is just a wild one and seemed to take quite an interest in me. Must have been my personality or robustly good looks. She's asking me all sorts of questions and I'm trying to maintain eye contact, but this lady had big enormous breasts, and it was very hard not to look. They could have used this lady's cleavage as a landing beacon at O'Hare airport during a snowstorm. And I make no mistakes about it, no female jacks their breasts up in a bra and top that's obviously too small and doesn't expect men to look. And if they do, they should be forced to wear a scarlet ""T"", for Titty, for being such an arrogant wench. So she keeps asking me what my feeling would be towards dating an older woman. So ask, how old? She says 34. I ask how old are you? She says, 34. OK, gee, where are we going with this one?  So the hours in the evening start to add on, as well as the cocktails. We left Margaritas and then hit the Harp and Hound, were the two women I was with started getting louder and crazier. Victoria is flirting with me a lot and seems to be doing everything in her power to make me blush. Like pulling down her pants to show me her lack of tan lines. And she was right, she had no tan lines. I'm three margaritas and two Guiness into the shit now, and I'm starting to think to myself, ""Pascoe, you got a pretty damn good shot here."" So the drinks and flirting continue, and she keeps ribbing me. At one point, and I'm still not sure why, she accused me of not believing her breasts were natural. I assured her I did, but that wasn't good enough for her. She grabbed me by my wrist and put my hand right on her left breast. ""Feel that, squeeze it, they're real!"" OK, at that point she got me. My little sailor was standing now at full attention (I can't believe I just referred to my penis as ""my little sailor""). 10 minutes after that, I'm giving the lady a foot massage in the middle of some restaraunt lounge. I'm thinking ""it's on now"". The other two mooks are looking tired and made it apparent that they wanted to go home and smoke weed, which Victoria told me she wasn't into. So I suggested that we stay out and I'd give her a ride home later. Well, her whole attitude changed at that point. She told me she thought I was very attracted and she liked me, but she wasn't into the whole ""casual sex thing"". She did want to exchange numbers, though, but at that point I was like, yeah whatever. I'm such a snob. So we're walking back to the cars and I decide to throw up a hail mary. I told her, ""You know, back in there when I was giving you the foot massage, I was really turned on"" (I can't believe I said that, let alone rubbed her feet). Suddenly her eyes light back up, ""Really???"" Apparantly so was she, and all of a sudden, I'm back in the ball game. So we're walking far ahead of the other two, who look like they ducked under an awning for a quicky. So as we're standing at the car waiting, the other two nowhere in sight now, I'll casually ask, ""Do you want to make out?"" She says, ""You mean just kiss?"" No stupid! Making out is my codeword for fucking you with a Corona bottle! ""Yeah, that's what I mean"". She oblidges to my suprise, and then says, ""Let's go over to that bench over there."" Right at the moment, Mike and his girlfriend pop back out of nowhere, like a pair of drunk, horny Caped Crusaders. ""Ready to go???"" Errrr......assholes!!!! So they invited me back to there place, which I learned was out by Mohegan Sun, and I didn't feel like driving out there or having to crash at there place at that point. I was much to drunk anyway. So I decided to head home. Victoria gave me a little kiss on the mouth and told me to call her. I said sure, lying. I would have done like Vince Vaughn in Swingers and just torn it up had I wrote it down rather than programed it into my phone. Because of her I was now going home to have sex with my hand.....again. Ehh, I shouldn't blame her, she was just a gal having a good time probably with no expectations, and I got to respect a lady who doesn't want to whore herself out after just meeting a guy. No...wait...actually, I don't in this case. I blame her completely. I'm sooo bitter.  So I got home and popped in the Best of Metro's Girls, but before I hit play, I saw that AE had the Andre The Giant biography on, which ended up saving me from forbidden carnal pleasure. The Giant's life was just so damn intriguing and sad, and lifes little chores were extremely stressful on this huge man, yet he lived every day to it's fullest and never looked back. Such a way to model your life, I thought, and was angry no more. I went to sleep after and slept like a baby, knowing that tomorrow was another day and that's this nights shortcomings were now the past. And Saturday went on to be a damn good one at that. Thank you Andre, thank you....   urlLink    RIP: 1946 - 1993  urlLink"	m

"I know you're all wondering about that title, but read the post and give it a chance before calling me a woman-hating chaeuvanist pig.  I have to come to terms with whether or not I really want a girlfriend again or whether I'd rather just keep that ""I don't give a shit about 'em"" mentality that I keep finding myself sinking into since me and my ex broke up for good.   Sometimes I miss having someone there to hold at night whom I can be totally open with, show affection to and share all of my feelings with. Then others, I remember all the arguements, the half-truths, the stress and the pressures that came along with everything else. That brings me back to reality. I wrote a poem about it...Like 'ta hear it go:  I've searched low and I've searched high, trying to find myself a cutie pie. My destination leads me to a dead end, over and over and over again. They say when you look one never finds. They also say that love is blind. It ain't that blind that I can't see, somebody out there who's perfect for me. It seems as if every time I find the right girl, she turns out to be the very wrong girl. Tell me y'all when will this madness stop? I want somebody to love me for me not because I'm emcee Heavy D. Sombody out there who's perfect for me.  Ok. So I didn't write that. So what. You know it would have came off a lot smoother had I said it instead of Heavy D...Big 350 pound ass dancing across the stage in Used Jeans, Cazal glasses and a hi-top fade with parts cut into it and shit. I won't hate, though, considering I did buy the album and played it to death back when I was a kid.   Now, the explanation of the title: Since I am currently free from the tyrrany and oppresion of pussy at the moment, I am giving my motivational asshole quotes so that some reader out there may use these gems of wisdom to get a good laugh and vent some frustration.

Reading Michelangelo's biography i couldn't help thinking how wonderful those times of creativity were. Artist would gather at determined places to work and share their discoveries about new techniques of illustration and painting, there was a lot of talent gathered creating what we now know as the great art of the renaissance.   Just imagining Florence at the end of the XIII century while it was a growing city brings a feeling of greatness to my soul, a feeling hardly inspired these days, days of war, politics, lies, massive consumption, advertising, violence, corruption... you name it.   Could there be a place in this world where good things are happening? Writers discussing the current human condition and plotting the great next novel compared to Dante or Machiavello. Painters and sculptors uncovering the reality of our vanity and total indifference to human misery. Philosophers fighting behind pen and paper to discuss ethics of the world consuming corporations lusting for power no matter what. Please, i want to know.	m
*sighs* If you have nothing to lose your'e losing everything aren't you? What an overly introverted question. I don't know how long this has been going on but I just realized that I have nothing and the more I think about it the worse it becomes. When I look back at my life I see a shitload of oppurtunities. What the hell have I done? Do I have bad judgement?  Am I too spontaneous?  For example,I recieved 1,000 dollars for graduation. I could've used that money for a new car. I could've used it to help me through college. But what did I do, hell i don't even know what I did with it all.  It's all a blur. 9 times out of 10 I feel like there is nothing in this hell hole of a world to live for. What hurts the most is living everyday knowing that I could be something better but not being willing to make it better.  How in the name of all that is good have I been depressed for more than half of my life and not have done anything about it? I don't even fucking feel anymore. I concentrate on nothing most of the time with the underlying feeling of hatred for myself.  My fucking head hurts. I hate this.  I hate writing in this god damn blog. It's not theraputic in any way. Fuck this.	f
"My office has never been noisy, that's for a fact. It borders between deathlike silence or funeral-like hushness. Occasionally when my DD (aka my boss) has one of his funny bone gone haywire, we'd have bursts of laughter and chortles.   But that's about all. Well, sometimes, the silence is kinda scary. It's like you can practically hear everything around you. That's why I tend to type loudly on my keyboard. Creation of sound in the absence of noise. (and to show I'm not skiving, though typing a blog during office hours is definitely SKIVE behavior)  Have any of you read Dan Brown's books? Read his famous (or infamous) Da Vinci's Code, and am now reading his Digital Fortress. Think the former makes a better read. Digi Fortress reads something like a half-hearted attempt to create suspense. (Although I admit Dan is good at making twists....but his twists are kinda pathetic). I compare him with other good Sci Fic writers like Philip Kerr..both of them back up their writings with some form of research. I've always like walking on the edges...some form of pseudo-reality fiction. (Haha)  My hubby (shameless me, I'm not even married yet) that it's kinda odd to write a blog. Who is the audience anyway? In a conventional diary, the audience is presumably yourself (unless you LOVE and expect other people to pry open your writings). But on the internet, the audience is practically everyone. Yet you are so AFRAID your blog will one day return to slap you. Just look at those poor chaps who revealed too much at the wrong time.   So it's kinda strange isn't it? I've read blogs which practically divulge EVERYTHING abt the writer, and blogs which are basically info-sharing, or porn. Whatever. The basic point is: it's still odd. But in our ""internet-age"", odd is no longer a word in the (online) dictionary.  Well, I like typing anyway, and blogging allows me freedom of thought and speech, without the need to structure or organise thoughts. Free flow, you'd say. Yeah, suppose so. I tend to write emails this way too. Drift here, drift there.   And of cos, blogs tend to serve the needs of exhibitionists. Or closet exhibitionist. Everyone has a streak of that in them. The need to show off, to shout to the world: ""Hey, can't you see I'm so important?"""	f

"1/7/04   7 days of blogging. Oh yeah, Hell's been freezin over for a while   Well......it's been a week of  blogging......and I still haven't missed a day of blogging yet. Wow do I feel proud right now.....I've actually stay commited to something =P. Well today was day 3 now of REALLY cold days. Apparently these 3 days in London have all been around -25 with windchill. COLD. But yah n e who.....today actually wasn't that bad though.....school wise n stuff......some interesting stuff happened.  Well one thing was it was wednesday, which means my day lasts from 6am (gr 10 band) until 9pm (Theory class). Well yah today I got to band......dead tired.....first time in 4 weeks we've had to do that....how I miss the wednesdays where I woke up @ 1......and did usual crap....ate, dressed, u know......and rushed to school. Wow. Only about 3/4 of band was there. band was actually not that long today.....usual crap....new songs......mr. clark bitching about the smallest mistake. ""YOU MADE THE DOWNBEAT HALF A MILISECOND EARLY."" That kinda crap.  Well after that grueling hour, it was time for.........MUSIC. oh how I hate day 2's. Wednesday day 2's I spend over 2 hours straight in stupid music room........grr.........sucks. We had our usual stuff.....technical stuff....then some theory......then annoucements. For some reason music goes by pretty slow now....with da new sub Mr. McCumbern or sometin. We've already had over 4 sub teachers this year. He used to teach at Banting or sometin......but anyways he's a pretty crappy teacher. N e who, announcements came on....blah blah.....then off to science.  HOLY CRAP WAS IT BORING! We watched a ""quiz movie."" I dunno wat the heck the teacher's federation thinks of or whatever da hell made the movie. You watch some A.D.D. retard for almost 40 minutes talking about clouds.....then 10 quiz questions come up.......what da hell ever happened to the teacher actually standing up there and teaching? Slackers.....they seem to find newer and newer ways to slack off. One of these days they're prolly gonna pay a student to do the teaching, or something. Maybe they'll dump school in the future. Wouldn't that be nice? A whole generation of illiterate children. WHOO HOO!=P  Lunch was to cold to go out........seriously I mite sometimes think cold isn't cold......but minus twenty-five is damn cold. I had to stay in n e ways though.......had a bio quiz next period. Was thinkin bout playing ball but half da gym was taken. And the ball half only one net was working. So I ended up working in the library....not so great, but yah I slept early last nite, so I didn't really do n e homework. Ended up watching Tv, drumming, and playing some Sc for the night. Beats bio.  Well Biology class was usual. Lecturing w/ ms. wiener's annoying ""fallowing's"" instead of following and other really retarted speech impediments. But we also had a quiz. Wasn't too pleased. Boring, n stuff. Oh yeah, I started to read the book ""Left Behind"" in this class. I heard from lots of people it's a good book....english teacher, church people, then Rachel Brown told me too who sits behind me. Apparently if it's the same Rachel Brown Calfun knows she's a Christian too. She said the book is ok, 2nd one sucks. Apparently there's like 9 books or sometin in the series now. I don't see how they can prolong the end of the world that long. But yah so far isn't bad. Some people are in a plane........people disappear...their personal items still lying around on the plane. Pilot panics, radios ground......finds out it happened all over the world. People in plane are panicking also. Yah right at the beginning of the book...Chaos. You kno it's a good book when. Then at the end of 4th, for some reason over 40 kids were called down to the office.....and all of em were in gr 10. I wouldn't know what was going on till the end of the day.  English class, since it is the most retarted class in the Ontario curriculum, I'll just summarize briefly. We had a work period for our revolution projects, where we are doing Chinese revolution. We didn't do much. Ended up talking most of the time. We just tried doing some relating w/ Animal Farm and how it was like any other revolution. But yah that was basically it. Teacher also said my book's good. But like I said that's it. Oh yah also........j/k that actually is it.  Well when I got home, I found out what happened after fourth. Jason told me his whole class revolted when Mr McKelvey moved the civics exam from 21st or sometin like that to Friday. ""Mr Mckelvey?"" ""Yes?"" ""You're an Asshole."" Someone said that according to Jason. So they sent a petition to Mr. Scanlon, and they won back their right to have it on original date somehow. I was surprised school actually has freedom, er freedom of speech. But yah that was main reason why almost 35 kids were called down to the office and all of em were in Grade 10. I'd like to do that with my careers presentation.....move it to after exams or somethin.  Well I got home, ate Gung Jai Mein.......mmmmmmmmmm.........fooooood. And then after that I drummed for a bit. Slept. Played Sc for a bit....really boring after playing it for 2 days it sucks.  Well I went to Theory @ 8.  Now I am sitting at home blogging. Wow......Ju Pah for dinner....almost forgot lol....wow this joke has been going around in LCAC for almost like 2 years. Funny how it came about. Well anyways I'm out now.......gonna go do some h/w and watch some TV maybe. *Zing*"	m

"Well, I'm getting ready for a pre-certification test that I have to take tomorrow in Pittsburgh.  I'm not looking forward to it.  I feel like I'm going to fail, which would really suck considering that Perla has already giving me rewards because I'm ""Going to  pass it.""  What a great surprise it'll be if I don't.  Heh.  I'm currently on a blistering pace for consecutive days of work.  Basing a day of 'work' as any day I spend time on the time clock, I've now been working for a personal best 10 straight days.  Given my schedule, it's going to be at least a total of fifteen days before I spend one day not ""officially"" working.  Yea!  Working on some final plans for vacation in my little spare time.  So far, the plans include a few days spend in Chattanooga, TN.  Kasey and I are also looking at possibly some time spent in Pigeon Forge, TN, and Charleston, SC.  If anyone has any suggestions as to places to see in the area, let me know.  As a side note, I found an interesting online test at  urlLink SparkLife .  It's a  urlLink gender test  that I simply had to take.  You have to sign up for an account, but it's free.  The test was 36% sure that I was a man without asking any questions about me personally.

"urlLink Michael Moore, Ugly American (washingtonpost.com)   This is really weird that this news came out because today as I was driving to work I was listening to Led Zeppelin thinking to myself, ""To compare Led Zeppelin to the Who is completely preposterous.  Their styles are completely different.  Led Zeppelin is straight up balls to the wall heavy blues rock and The Who is yippy skippy heavy pop/punk rock with a few cool synthesizer noises every now and then.  Actually, I think the Who is more like arena rock.  John Bonham and Keith Moon have completely different styles.  Bonham's playing is a lot more heavy and bass heavy.  Jimmy Page is more of a riff player whereas Pete Townshend is the songwriter of the two guitarists.  Robert Plant's voice screams as if his life depended on it, whereas Roger Daltry screams as if he had future plans of appearing on Time/Life infomercials for Rock compilation albums.  The only thing that is the same between the two bands is the appearance of their lead singers.  In my opinion, the only thing that made Keith Moon's drumming all that special was the fact that he blew up his kit with some dynamite.  But I could do that and I don't even play drums.""  In conclusion, it's pretty cool that Pete Townshend doesn't like Michael Moore, because neither do I, but that doesn't make the Who better than Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin kicks my ass whereas the Who just tickles it a little bit."	m
i'm afraid... afraid for me,i'm afraid for others... i don't wanna die but i kno that i will never reach old age....there is something sad and exciting about that... so that leaves me with little time to experience a full life...'cause u never kno when the final bomb is gonna drop... the only thing that i'm really afraid of is the pain...does it hurt to die? i supposed so...and what am i to do if when the final bomb drops am i gonna have children already? if i do what am i going to do about them...i don't want to see my children in pain...  if i knew that the world was ending (for sure) years before the bomb dropped would i be selfish enough to bring them into the world knowing full well that they will never grow old and live full lives...i hope to god that i don't...  but what if i got pregnant by mistake or some fault not known to me...would i keep that child?the thing is i don't believe in abortion so i think that i would keep those children or child and let them lead as full lives as they could before time is up.  so if it came down to me live and they die....i would give it all up for them..i would give my life for them... i don't wanna die.	f

"More stuff from Thomas Merton's book  urlLink Opening the Bible ...    ""We have to recognize that those for whom the Bible has become a habit may well defraud themselves of deeper understanding by deciding in advance what they want of the Bible and what it wants of them. They go to the Bible knowing in just what ways it suits them. They dig in to satisfy their own needs - and of course they are not wrong. But the Bible is not merely to satisfy our needs or togive us what suits us...   It may be supremely disconcerting, ambiguous, even frightening. It may shock our reason into unbelief, and we may have to struggle with it as a scandal.""  [p. 36]    ""There is, in aword, nothing comfortable about the Bible - until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves. But then we are perhaps too used to it and too at home in it. Let us not be too sure we know the Bible just because we have learned not to be astonished at it, just because we have learned not to have problems with it. Have we perhaps learned at the same time not to really pay attention to it? Have we ceased to question the book and be questioned by it? Have we ceased to fight it? Then perhaps our reading is no longer serious. For most people the understanding of the Bible is, and should be a struggle: not merely to find meanings that can be looked up in books of reference, but to come to terms personally with the stark scandal and contradiction in the Bible itself.""

"Today is going just like every other day for the last 2 weeks since school ended. I woke up at 11 am; it seems that I'm waking up later and later as vacation progresses. I usually actually wake up around 9 but decide to just stay in bed... what a great life! After having my usual pop tarts for breakfast, I came up to my room, where I am trying to organize all my school papers, a task I've been too lazy to start for months. What's great about summer is that you get to do a lot of thinking when there are no pressing deadlines or anything. I've had so many great ideas over the past few weeks, but what's tragic is that so many of them are forgotten before I can write them down. Imagine how much greater the world would be if people never forgot great ideas they have. I don't think I've been myself lately. Not just lately as in the past few weeks or months, but years. Probably ever since I got to high school. I don't remember ever feeling truly comfortable. I haven't  really  laughed with my ""friends"" in high school. This past year, I felt like an emotional wreck all the time, sometimes just angry at everything around me, but mostly too tired to care about anything. I've noticed that I'm usually angriest during the afternoon. I've realized that the afternoon just isn't my time of day. I'm more of a middle-of-the-night person. That's when I am the most productive, when there are no distractions, and when no one else is working. I guess then that I must love solitude and being away from people. That makes perfect sense. I absolutely hate waiting in long lines for anything, I hate crowded movie theaters-I love seeing movies midday on a weekday- and I guess I love going anywhere during the off-season. I don't necessarily think I'm antisocial, I just think that I don't like having to compete with a buncha other people to get my message out. I can just see myself as the guy working behind the scenes who does the most important work but gets no credit. Anyway, I want to revisit the post that got deleted. I was musing on how I hate those people who seem to do everything - do everything well, I might add - with a smile on their face and no sign of stress. Many people seem to fit into this category. Everything seems to be perfect for them. They're smart, athletic, charismatic, hard-working, and funny, and they never seem to get tired. ARGH how I wish I could be more like that. I guess I don't despise them as much as I envy them--or should I say the idealized image they project. I'm sure that no one, no matter how ""talented"" (i'll comment on this word later) can really be that perfect. Deep down they've got to be enduring stress and pressure just like the rest of us. They just have some driving motivation that keeps them going through the inevitable obstacles. So I guess we all need to find that one thing that keeps us going. I don't think I've found mine. That's why I'm so lazy and why I'm getting so disorganized. Heck, people might think that  I'm  one of those perfect people. Hah! I may be smart and seemingly organized, but I definitely have a lot of flaws. Which brings me to ""talent."" I don't think that those perfect people are ""talented""; in fact, they may be the opposite. See, I think talent is not memorizing and regurgitating information or working until you're exhausted. Talent is being able to discover something or produce something original, like a song, a work or art, or just a good idea. Talented people are those who try to get closer to the meaning of life (I know it sounds cliche). I believe that there are so many things to discover in the world--the infinite ways that everything is related to everything else. Even the slightest change can produce great effects. That's why I believe that, in everything in life, one must look at the details to produce truly great results. That just reminds me of that volkswagen commercial, where someone picks up something for someone else, then the second person helps out another person, who helps out someone else, and so on. The little things in life are what make it memorable. Those perfect people are working so hard that life is just gonna pass them by.  This isn't all. Trust me, I've got more rant to come..."	m
"The United States invaded Iraq under the leadership of George W. Bush after three months of deliberation in the U.N. Security Council. Of the three permanent members that opposed the war, Russia and France both had multibillion dollar trade with the Hussein regime, and China is redder than a maraschino cherry. I don't really give a damn what the French think of the war, and anyone who does needs to realize that the last time the French needed more proof of a threat, it marched into Paris under a German flag, and should also realize that the French are socialistic morons.  So, with the French and Germans bent upon our failure in Iraq, several members of the American left decided to try and stop the war by protesting, and Bush-bashing. Their slogan became, under Michael Moore and others, that our brave men and women had died for nothing. After the WMD intelligence, which had been previously supported by France, Russia, Germany, and the U.N. proved to be 'false,'* the left vamped up their Bush-bashing and their slogan became, ""Bush lied, soldiers died...for nothing, for a lie.""  The left claims they do this to support the soldiers, but does that make sense? To support the soldiers, but not their cause is tantamout to supporting the Gay Rights Organization, but not supporting gay rights.  Suppose you are in Iraq, serving your country. Every day on the news, you see Michael Moore, Al Franken, and others saying, ""Our soldiers are fighting and dying for no reason. They don't need to be over there."" Doesn't that minimize your efforts as a soldier?  The fact is, whether the left admits it or not, our brave soldiers overthrew a dictator and liberated a nation. But you won't hear the left say, ""Thank you, soldiers, for overthrowing an evil man."" And when I say that, the left says, ""But that's not the reason they were given.""  But you know what? I'm a firm believer in giving these men and women hope, appreciation, and love. The left is giving them none of that. The left is giving them a feeling that they are dying for no reason, that no one appreciates what they've done in Iraq.  Take the example of Lila Limpscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, who is featured in Michael Moore's latest, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' It seems Ms. Limpscomb initially supported the war and the President, but then recieved word that her son had died, shortly before receiving a letter from her son criticizing President Bush and the war effort. Can you blame him? Everyday he hears that he's basically accomplished nothing in Iraq.  Lila takes this very hard. But Michael Moore is there to manipulate the greiving Ms. Lipscomb into promoting his leftist cause. He could have said, ""Lila, I appreciate your son's service. He died honorably and courageously. He answered his country's call, and he helped to remove a brutal dictator."" If my brother was killed in Iraq, I would take comfort from that more than Mr. Moore's message of choice, paraphrased. ""Yes, Lila, your son died for nothing. He died for a lie, he died to secure oil for corporate fatcats. You only have one way to help his memory...to join the Antiwar effort.""  In short, ladies and gentlemen: You can't support our troops by destroying the glory in what they've done, and invalidating the sacrifices they've made in our country's name. If the leftists truly cared about our men and women in uniform, they would put aside political bickering**, which gets nobody anywhere, and support our troops. The bad intelligence is behind us, there's nothing we can do to change that. What we can do is support our troops and glorify their cause. They deserve as much.  *False intelligence? I've got news for you, people. Until we wanted to go to war, NO ONE doubted this intell was false. John Kerry called himself one of the biggest supporters of regime change in Iraq. France, and the rest of the UN 'reprimanded' Saddam frequently for breaking resolution 1441 and producing WMDs. Basically, we let Saddam go totally unchecked for about 3 months while the UN decided to move Weapons Inspectors into Iraq. If you were Saddam, and you knew that Bush would invade the hell out of you if you had weapons, and you had 3 months without anyone watching you (or your Syrian border), What would you do?  **I hate it when I hear people say, ""I'll vote for Kerry to spite/remove Bush."" It doesn't make sense. Kerry's  foreign policy, until he says otherwise, is exactly the same as President Bush's, minus a few vague remarks about making the US more trustworthy in the world. (This trust will last until the French don't want to deal with a threat, and instead would like to sit around, smoke, and let their armpit hair grow.) Kerry, Bush, and even Nader have all said they would leave the troops in Iraq. So why the hell vote for Kerry?"	m

I had the worst nightmare ever last night. My boyfriend (have no idea who it was) and I were driving along the Penang Bridge (I was the driver) late at night. I know it was late because it was dark and there were no cars on the street. I saw the speedometer needle at 150km/hr and while going round a bend on the bridge, I leaned over to kiss him on the cheek. The car instantly skidded, I jammed on the brakes as hard as I could but to no avail, we hit the railing and the car flew off the bridge into the water. Everything was happening in slow motion, it was as though I was a third party watching the scene. I was fortunate enough to be thrown out of the car before the car sank.   The next thing I knew it was morning, and I was watching the car being pulled out of the water. The rescuers opened the car door and my dead boyfriend fell out. I went into hysterics and at that moment, I woke up with a start. What a crap way to start my day!   Anyway, today is probably the closest day Singapore can ever get to winter. It was windy, cool, raining and gloomy. I love this kinda weather. It’s perfect for sleeping and reminds me of Oz. 	f
this week i was pretty bummy.  not in a bummy mood- but just bummy as in sitting on my butt all day.  oh yes! i found out what my job title is going to be- 'embedded software engineer 1'. YAY!  friday will/i went out to the city and had lunch with will's bestman michael at the waterfront.  we did the dine-about-town thingee- it was yummy!  then we shopped a bit- nothing really crazy don't worry.  actually, will had bought me this gucci organizer in like 2002 for my birthday, and i had used it a bit and then stopped using it- partly because who needs such a nice organizer for class?  but now that im going to be working soon- YAY- i needed to get refills for it!  so off to the gucci store we go and i buy refills for 2004.  they are so boring.  really!  just a plain calendar with lined paper.    next stop- kate spade!  i realize when i get there that their refills for their organizers fit into my gucci one!  and of course- me being such a katespade FREAK- i have will go return the gucci refills- and i buy buy buy all the different cute ones at kate spade!!  yay!!seriously.  i really am kate spade obsessed.  next.  we stopped by the thomas pink store- they were having a sale!  we found this really nice shirt for will- the right size- but when he tried it on- it was too big!  will had to get a 'slim' cut!  thats how much weight will is losing.  grrrrrrr.    yesterday we made a boston cream cake.  it was yummy- but i think we could have made it yummier!  oh yes and we went to sushi house with kareen/andy/jenn/ray.  we got there and once we put our name down- there were 32 parties in front of us.  ACK!  so we ended up just ordering it to-go- which took about half an hour anyway.  im going to miss the bay area!!!!	f

The day starts with me waking up at about 10:20 in the morning. This is extremely late for me, but reasonable as I was awake until about 2 earlier in the morning. I was not doing anything exciting, except play Sim City 3000. Me, in Melbourne, on a Friday night- indoors playing a computer game- that is rather sad, even by my standards. I do have an excuse (kind of) though. At 23 years of age- I still have not bothered to get my drivers licence. And I cannot be bothered riding on a train or bus for over an hour from the city to get home either. I only ever go out when one of the major city clubs come out to the suburbs to play in one of the local night spots. I recently went out to a night put on by local clubs,  urlLink Bass   urlLink Station , and the following week, Hard Kandy. Both are more hardcore dance clubs- with faster music and yeah… the kind of music you jump up and down to (and for many people- take your drugs to) I must admit- I have never done drugs of any sort out in public, but still act as if I am on them- dancing like a crazed lunatic. I only go out to clubs in Melbourne very rarely- like once or twice a year. I am not sure if this is because I have grown out of them, or because I generally cannot be bothered leaving my house to go out.   When I was living in  urlLink Brisbane , I used to go out every single weekend to this nightclub called the Beat in Fortitude Valley. I used to think it had the best music, and yeah, I would be dancing up on the tables all night long making an idiot of myself- all without alcohol or drugs. I do drink, occasionally at parties and gatherings etc, but very very rarely out at clubs- water is the drink of choice for me there. When I tried to drink alcohol at the dance club- I found I could not dance very well at all, so I decided that I would stick to water…. That and the fact it is so much cheaper as well! I went out every weekend while living in Brisbane, right up until when I moved to Melbourne- and then all of a sudden I stopped going out to clubs all together. Perhaps one day I will get out there and party on again, but I really doubt it. For a start, I would have no idea as to what to wear to a night out in Melbourne. I hate dress codes- too casual, too formal, no black….. May as well just sit at home and download some music and dance away in the lounge room…. Fun fun fun.  Today is another fantastic  urlLink sunny  Melbourne day, again above 30 degrees. It is meant to be about 37 tomorrow, I am not really looking forward to that, however the warmer night tonight should be fun. It will feel like I am back in north Queensland again…. Perhaps.  Then it is back to work on Monday. I really do not feel like going back to work after so long off on long weekends and sick leave (I had a sore throat the other week, was out of action for a whole week just before the xmas break and all).   Today I decided to go to the garage and vacuum the spider webs from the corners and ceiling of the garage. I have sprayed them all before with surface spray and bug killer- but nothing works. In any case, the garage now looks a lot neater and there are a lot less spiders in it. There were quite a few more than I was expecting, and it looked as if it was just breeding season for the spiders, the majority of which were daddy long-legs spiders. I found quite a few egg sacs, as well as lots of baby spiders. Up the vacuum they went. I have ducted vacuum, so they will remain in the bag until it is time to remove them in about a years time.   There really is nothing more to write about today- it is just another lazy Saturday afternoon…. I don’t feel like doing anything at all, so I won’t. Fantastic.  Catchyas	m

"Wannabe Quitter: This is a cry for help     Ever tried.  Ever failed.  No matter.  Try again.  Fail again.  Fail better.  -- Samuel Beckett    To begin, I have a request/’informercial’ for all you non-smoking “winners” out there…   Don’t give me any more crap about quitting smoking.  I’ve heard enough of it.  Honestly. I’ve said this 1000 times before – Quitting smoking is harder than many non-smokers would believe… maybe a doctor’s note will get your attention…  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  “'Nicotine is  highly addictive , to a degree similar or in some respects  exceeding  addiction to 'hard' drugs such as  heroin  and  cocaine'   - Source ""Nicotine Addiction In Britain""  Report by Royal College Of Physicians – London  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That’s right –  friggin’ heroin …    Back off.   In fact, the only drug more addictive than nicotine is cocaine – which is, in fact, the most addictive substance known to man.   Non-smokers seem hell-bent on enlightening all of us idiot smokers as to the dangers of our vice. Here’s a bit of  urlLink truth  for you…  70 percent of smokers  want to quit . Only about 5% actually succeed every year. Every year, 95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successful…  I’ll say that last one again…   95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successful.   Give me a break. It’s fucking hard… and “Nic Fits” aren’t the worst of the withdrawl symptoms… that’s right – symptoms plural… Here’s a chunk from the laundry list of withdrawl symptoms:   fatigue, lack of concentration, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, (and an increased tendency to dream… which actually isn’t bad at all – sorry for wasting your time with that one), headaches, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. These symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last cigarette. Symptoms peak within the first few days and may subside within a few weeks. For some people, however, symptoms may persist for months or longer... Oh and indigestion, nausea, diarrhea and sore throats…yes…  all of them at the same time .   There you go, eh? Ain’t THAT a bitch…  And that’s just the physical repercussions.  A number of smokers are addicted to the ritual of smoking - the feel, smell, and sight of a cigarette and the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette are all associated with the happy times that smoking brings and can make withdrawal or craving worse. While nicotine gum and patches may alleviate the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. In other words, the patch and gum won’t work for some…  at all.  Fun, eh?  And, believe it or not, most of us smokers are hip to this jive. We know well enough what smoking does to us because… well we’re living the dream, kids. We also have intimate knowledge of how hard (damn near impossible) it is to quit smoking because… well most of us have tried and failed numerous times. So to you non-smokers who are harping on us to “just quit”, give it a rest already. Your constant bleatings aren’t helping. We’re wrestling with forces all but unknown to you – your efforts are certainly appreciated but… well damn… leave us alone. We’ll get there… your pressure isn’t helping at all. There… all done with that  :::adjusting tie:::  :::stepping down from soapbox:::  This whole deal is really about my latest failed quitting smoking effort. About two months ago I decided to give it the ol’ college try and clear the air. And, believe it or not, I was doing pretty good for a while there. My plan this time (probably gleaned from some online remedy mag or some such)  was to keep a diary recording each and every cigarette that I smoked – that’s right… every one… time, date, and, get this, motivation… awww yeah! I thought keeping a diary would be encouraging, you know? I’d see my smoking decreasing over time and get a confidence boost. ‘least that’s how it was supposed to work. I printed my quit date in HUGE letters and numbers on the front of the damn thing and, for a while, I was excited about the prospect of being smoke free. Then.. well things fell apart. Here… take a look…    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Feb 22 or 2.22.04    Day 1    10:01 AM   …by the microwave clock. First smoke of the day. Quitting smoking IS a pretty daunting task... but… I think I can I think I can.. gonna try and get Scotty to join me. Maybe the Squatch? I think he’ll quit if I quit 1:38 PM Smoke #2 before I go to play D2 w/Ed. Played a fair amount of guitar – felt good. A possible distraction from precious sweet nic-o-teen?   3:12 PM  My jaw hurts? Had a beer and feel like a smoke. Much easier to say “yes” after a beer… (noted)   7:?? PM  Smokey-poo as I took out the trash and headed to pick up an application and some namby-pamby soda… ugh… isn’t beer enough? Damn you…:::reading bottle::: …coca-cola.   10:14 PM  Excited! Only 5 [smokes] in twelve hours. I swore I was much worse off. This may be easier than I thought…   1:55 AM  Smoking w/Sasquatch… I find if I drink or stay up too late, I smoke more… I know I know… lemme tackle ONE vice @ a time    Day 2    7:05 AM  Slept like an ANGEL! Man-oh-man! Smokey-poo! More guitar planned today along w/some toolin’ around “Sasquatch Style”. Should be fun. Yesterday? 6 smokes in 16 hours. I think I can match that or do better.   10:40 AM  Put off smoking for 40-60 min after I wanted one. Tension, thy name is Nicotine Deprivation. Time for a smoke. Es la hora del fumar.  1:20 PM  After a nap (good sleep) had a smoke.- no more afternoon naps. It’ll probably help my sleep schedule.  3:53 PM  basically 4 PM… smoke break from D2 – gotta get some guitar in at some point… quitting smoking shouldn’t come with guilt…    Day 3    7:36 AM  Ok.. guitar is definitely a distraction from smoking. I’ve decided to go regimental and break down my technique… namely chord shapes.  8:30 PM  Prolly gonna have one on the way to get The Slater… I’ll get an estimation down when I get back. Hand hurts a little but good hurtin’… from guitar… I swear… :::shame:::  3:30 AM  Total of 4… Stressful event… no more smokes… is that a good thing?... Squatch has some… I’ll limit my bumming :::sleep:::    Day 4    11:30 AM  Up by 10:10 – First smoke of the day. Might be goin’ to see Scotty or Bren today. Win-win the way I see it.  1:30 PM  Smoke  5:30 PM  Smoke  7:45 PM  Smoke  11:45 PM  Smoke  2:00 AM  Smoke    Day 5   10:00 AM  First smoke – expecting some stress today. Hope it doesn’t up the smoke count. What can I use as a counter?  1:42  … OK OK… I went overboard a little. Got to bed by 11 though… that’s good.    Day 6    8:55 AM  Been up since 7:30… Made myself get plenty of sleep. Put off first smoke until now. Seeming very possible to quit for good  10:45 AM  Back… my back… smoke… lay down  1:39 PM  Smokey-poo! Bored out of my mind  5:58 PM  Smoke… 3?! WOW! :::happy:::  9:09 PM  Don came by… smokey-poo  10:30 PM  Don is still here… … smokey-poo!!    Day 7   4 smokes in here somewhere… I was out all day    Day 8   No smokes until 7ish (PM). GO Drew GO, eh? Went to Scotty’s and had 3… habit. Hope for tomorrow… one more before bed makes 5… again.    Day 9    11:36 AM  Smoke… been slacking on the whole journal deal. I’ll put a stop to that…    Day 13    11:15 AM  …yeah… I know… slacker… but one today so far… I think I may just have to cut myself off and deal… food and working out will help…    Day 14    Superbowl Sunday  :::’nuff said:::    Day 15   1st smoke @ noon… that’s kinda good, eh?   Then… there is what I have figured to be a random drunken scrawling by me which reads… Your pussy smells like (frat) gin, whore   …:::???:::    Final Entry    Failed  though my sex drive is through the goddamn roof… ‘least my body is happy to have felt alive, eh?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   So what happened, you ask?  :::deep breath:::  …lack of concentration, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. indigestion, nausea, diarrhea…  …yeah – all of that while the rest of life was chugging right along. Talk about frustrating. Something happened, though, that made me rethink quitting altogether.  I was at work and a man came up to the counter. He looked like he had been in a washer and dryer set to “Old” for most of his life. One of the two of his yellowing eyes was split open a bit at the bottom and :::gag::: it was oozing thick yellowish… schtuff.  :::Christ:::  Oh but it gets better. He had SEVERAL holes in his neck and to talk to me he had to use one of those doohickeys that makes folk sound like Robot Jones. On top of all of this, he only had enough breath to utter one word at a time. He used what could have very been the last of his breaths to say these three words…  Skoal…  …Wintergreen…  …Longcut…  :::SHIT!:::  Now THAT’S a fucking addiction.   (note: Skoal is smokeless or ‘chewing’ tobacco – Wintergreen is a flavor they offer and longcut is one of two varieties of Skoal[the other being ‘fine cut’] … thus Skoal Wintergreen Longcut is what he was asking for – visit http://www.ussmokeless.com/ for more info)   I’ve done some pretty terrible things in my lifetime but damn it if this wasn’t one of the absolute worst… I sold it to him. Every part of me knew that it was wrong to do so… that I should have said “no” and let myself be fired or just quit on the spot or something… anything demonstrating a little moral backbone. But no, I sold it to him and got regret and nightmares in return.  After that, I started to notice more and more how many people come in for their fix of nicotine – people with sickly eyes yellowing fingernails and brown teeth… people breathing heavier than any pedophile or phone sex operator could ever dream… people carrying the sick stink of tobacco… dead people really. A third of the people I’ve sold that shit to will die from it. These are people who otherwise lead normal lives. These are people who started smoking to piss off their parents or because their brother did or to fit in with the cool kids or any other number of reasons. These are people, most of them, who don’t want to be there… standing in front of me and asking for death… People tired of being a slave to a few ounces of dried leaves.. These people don’t want to smoke.  I remember back to those bullshit drug education courses in grades 1-12… I remembered all the bogus reports we had to do and all the little factoids we had to swallow and regurgitate on paper. I remember mostly how smoking was never made out to be a big deal. Heroin, coke, speed, PCP… hell… even alcohol and marijuana… THOSE were the bad guys. Tobacco was just their naughty underling… a clever parrot on the shoulder of a big bad pirate.  …right.  :::shaking head:::  I haven’t yet given up on quitting smoking. I’ll make it soon enough. Picking up smoking was a huge mistake that me and millions of other people have made. We had no idea what we were getting into and, what with social whatnots being what they are, smoking is ok… even cool. It is… honestly. Imagine James Dean without one… see?  Anywho, I’m actually gonna go have a cigarette. Not only for the sake of irony but also… well… I’ll fucking bite the head off of a nun if I don’t suck down some poison. This one’s for you, weird eye dying guy… I’ll quit for both of us.  -- Dexter Otis Green"	m
Man from my past  Browsing weblogs through links at  urlLink Foldedspace.org , I happened across a link for an elementary school in my former hometown.  I'd never heard of this school, so, curious, I clicked around for more information and what do you know: the principle of this elementary school is the same, hateful Vice-Principle who helped make my life a living hell when I was in 7th and 8th grade, at the recently mentioned  urlLink Ackerman Junior High .  Mike Zagyva.  The name still makes me feel vaguely sick to my stomach.	f
"Update on Offshore Power Off Long Island  Kim Acevedo has an   article  in Herald online entitled ""Winds of Change to Power Long Island"" (2/13/2003) reports that since the release of the Long Island Power Authority RFP seeking a developer for an offshore wind farm, various groups in the area have expressed interest in the proposal.  The article reports that:   The wind turbines would be located at least 2.5 nautical miles -- 2.875 statute miles -- offshore. The hum they produce would rarely, if ever, be audible from shore, officials said. ""This site has been chosen very carefully,"" Lowndes said.  The height of the wind turbines, with one blade straight up, would be approximately 360 feet to 428 feet above the surface of the water. They might be visible from shore on a clear day, Lowndes said. The park would have between 25 and 50 turbines that would produce a total of 100 to 140 megawatts of electricity on an optimal day.  The described location of the proposed wind projects within three miles of shore places them in state waters (which extend three miles from shore) and thus, avoids the jurisdictional, ""who owns the land"" squabble jeopardizing the Cape Wind Project off Nantucket as we've described in other posts.  More information on the RFP is available  here  at LIPA's website."	f

Perspective   It's something I don't even think to do very much. Sometimes I find myself standing in a different spot in my home, a place I don't ever stand or go. Maybe it's the corner of a spare bedroom you don't visit much during your busy life routine, right where that chair used to be. And suddenly you wonder why you've never stood in this spot before in your own familiar home.  And somehow everything seems a little different. You can really trip yourself out this way.	f

"We sincerely apologize for Mara. She’s just a bit dramatic in her storytelling. We love her dearly, but she tends to be a little… overzealous. I think that it might be time to introduce ourselves and tell a little bit about why we came to be here; and why we’re sharing our stories.    We must conceal some detail of ourselves and our work in order to protect our own lives and keep our operations safe for the future. The three of us make up the world’s last and best defense against the evils of the world. Revenant vampyres occur all the time. We try to be careful in our breeding and our seeding of humans; however, its not always possible to know beforehand how these things will turn out. Occasionally, we must strike down one of our own kind in order to preserve the natural order of things, and our way of life.     My name is Ireth. I was born a long time ago, under another name, during a time when Egypt was a fairly young land. I was human then, and a priestess, of a goddess who's name has long since been forgotten. She was a Mother, a nurturing presence of the Earth. I have lost much of my old religion, but I do believe in Her still, and I hope she hasn't forgotten me. To go through my entire past would take much more time than the humans who will read this have to live. I will tell you that I have punished myself for my existence far more than anyone else on this earth ever could have. But I no longer believe that I am evil by my very nature. I have learned much over these many years of myself, and the world in which we live.     I have been a priestess, a beggar, a Lady, a singer, a festival performer; I was even a queen, once. Now, I am proud to tell you that I am part of something much larger than myself. We call ourselves Dante's Demons after the fictional character who traveled through Hell. We named ourselves this because the three of us have all journeyed through our own personal hells and come out the other side, not only stronger, but extraordinarily so. I'm very proud to say that where I once spent centuries wandering through time aimlessly, I now have a purpose. My purpose is to protect those weaker than myself and uphold the name of good wherever I can.     Some of you may be wondering... You must have figured out by now that I am a vampyre. I was born more years ago than I can remember. So why, when history has painted my entire species as evil, would I ""uphold the name of good""? Ah, because Mara was correct, of course. Not everything is as the stories speak of them. Just as not all humans are good, not all of my kind are evil. Actually, good and evil are relative ideals. Some of my kind even believe that good and evil are myths thought up by the human mind. I, however, believe very much in good. Perhaps that's just because I want to believe. I want to believe I'm good. And I want to believe that when this world is done with me, then I may go home to my Goddess and be content until time and the world end.     I did not mean to spend such time here, but it is cathartic to speak to you all after so much time has passed. I have much to bestow upon the world; but even I cannot do that all at once. Mara, Symone and I have work to do this evening. Perhaps one of us will even tell you about it when we return. Farewell until next time and remember:        Damnant quod non intellegunt.          ""They condemn what they do not understand."""	f
"Well, I wanted to tinker with a blog setting or two just to see the effects before I made this public.  So now, tinkering complete, I'm satisfied.  I used to know a goodly amount of html, but that was for the two weeks I had to write a web page for my Advanced Programming class in college.  The page got an 'A', but the knowledge got the boot.  Making room for such vital information as the distance of Earth from the sun and lyrics to songs I am ashamed to mention.  Anyway, so it looks like my initial entry worked just fine.  Not that this is brain surgery, but sometimes it's a nice feeling when something (technology to be specific) works the way it should.  Perhaps it is my recent dealing with a particularly irritating piece of tech-ery that makes something as simple as a web page successfully updating seem like the discovery of fire.  The culprit is DirecTV.  I have (or had) them as my satellite service provider.  The system was installed last year, though they had to drill a hole or three through my walls--rather than patching through the existing cable--to get things to work.  Well, things have been mostly fine, with the exception of a garbled signal when it rains... or looks like it may rain... or when I say the word ""rain""...  But anyway, the past few weeks have been exceptionally bad regardless of weather conditions.  It was as if scrambled porn and a turn table with Tourette's had a love child on every single channel.  Anyway, so I made a service call and the guy says, ""Yeah, this should never have been installed here.  Your trees in the backyard are directly in the dish's line of sight.""  Yeah, a little irritating.  Well, he suggested that I could raise the dish, but I would need to check with my Home Owner's Association.  Fine.  That makes sense.  Oh, and I have to buy and cut a special fencing pipe myself.  Less fine.  Less sense.  But I'm still amiable.  So I do all of the above and reschedule a service call.  The man calls at the beginning of when he's supposed to be there asking if I had permission and the equipment.  ""Yes, that is what I was told to do and why you're scheduled to come out.""  Then he claims that ""they've"" got him all over the place today so he might not make it.  Well, sorry, but am I not one of those places?  He had from 1pm to 5pm and I had plans at 7.  So 5:30, still not there and I call to tell him forget it.  I call DirecTV and see if they can make an appointment on Sunday which they can't because that's special and handled locally and blah blah... things I understand, but am too irritated to care about.  Then on top of that, he mentions that the comment on the work request says I needed to have permission to raise the dish ""in writing"" from the HOA.  What!?  More hoops to jump through.  More irritation.  The customer service guy tries to say how bad he's got it because he has to open the window in his apartment on cloudy days.  I try to care, but fail to.  I spent the rest of the day pondering if it was worth it.  And then the answer came to me.  As I was flipping through the 99.9% garbled junk, one channel comes in clearly.  It was running the movie "" urlLink From Justin To Kelly "".  Fortunately the sound was muted, but even in closed caption it made me a little sick to my stomach.  This is when I realized that things just weren't going to work out between me and DirecTV.  I called, got my service disconnected as of midnight that night, and the next day in the mail got a promo to ""Ditch The Dish"" and get $400 from  urlLink Comcast  cable, which is what my neighborhood is prewired for.  So... life sucks for a short period of time, then things change to make it even--if not slightly better.  I suppose that ""crappy satellite reception"" runs low on the list of the world's problems, but there you have it."	m

I'm back from Junior Miss! YAY! First, I'd like to start off by saying that my good friend KARA GIROD is the 2005 Oregon's Junior Miss! She has announced me as her personal trainer. I am very excited about that!  I have a lot to say but I don't really feel like saying it all. So I'll just say a few things. I had a great time, we went to Nike which rocked. I seriously want an internship or something there.  Also, I have said 'seriously' and 'definitely' way too many times to count this week. The insanity must stop.  The girls were all pretty cool, and ALL of them had some amazing talent or personality trait, it rocked so hard. I got pretty close with a few girls...  Kellianne was my roommate, the one everyone wanted to meet because she is very good looking. She's really nice but was definitely there to win. And because I am the devil, I got a lot of pleasure out of telling her how amazing Kara is, knowing that she would then see Kara as serious competition. I also got a lot of pleasure when Kellianne placed second to Kara. Oh the joys.  ( I just reread that paragraph - I said serious and definitely... I  told  you I have a problem...)  Erin is an Mormon girl from Salem. She was really funny and I got along with her really well. There were four Mormon girls in the competition, yet only three modest dresses... curious. Anyway, Erin was a blessing to me because we held pretty much the same view of the competition, and she knows Addison! So, we get to hang out very soon :)  Sara and I constantly talked about mashed potatoes with garlic and potato salad. If you don't know what that means, you'll have to ask me in person sometime. We also talked about Lester the Molester, the guy who sang... and winked, and whispered in our ears and checked us out. He was the creepiest of the creepy and we were supposed to flirt with him on stage! I think not. We had a lot of fun talking about potatoes and Lester.  Jennifer got the overall scholastics award, and I was so proud of her! She works so hard for her grades, she deserves it. I overheard another girl talking about how she was kind of surprised she didn't get that award, and I just thought to myself, Jennifer probably won by a landslide.  My host family was a lot of fun. All week long their 14 year old boy had a thing for Kara. He didn't really but he thought she was pretty so we teased him about it. And I had a really cool conversation with my host mom, she has a very interesting perspective, especially about how my mom must feel and stuff.  Sil said my interview went really well, which is great, coming from Sil. They kept giving me really hard questions, asking about voting and gay marriage and why I would ever want to go to BYU. I felt like I was defending myself the whole time. It turns out, the harder the questions the better interviewer they think you are. So, thats pretty freaking rad.  A lot of things rocked this week. Still, a lot of things did not. And it is odd how I have changed just by spending a week with a bunch of girls. I look at a lot of things differently and I really appreciate some things now. Like some of the friends I have here at home. But I will miss all the free stuff I got. Those were good times...    Sky rockets in flight... afternoon delight...	f

urlLink    This is where I would like to be going today. Across the wooden bridge to the Island on the other side.

"Hi I'm here and it's only 10 school days until my winter vacation or only 8 or 9 if you consider one day we will have a full movie day because lots of people won't be there because of a volleyball game all day and another day we'll have a winter presentation for the little kids  . So really it's only 8 days . Oh yah I forgot to tell you my grades for school well all you need to know is that I got all ""A""s except for one crappy ""B+"" in french . And it also it occurred to me that nobody is reading this GOD DAMNED blog so I don't care about me I'll just     crawl into this corner . Hmm.. Wonder if they bought it  oh damn I'm still typing . Well good bye to any one who's reading"	m
"Folks, sorry it has taken so long to post an update... too busy skiing, boozing, and well... uh...other misadventures that I always seem to get myself into while in the mountains.  Let's see... where to start...   urlLink Boy  with a broken neck told he is madly in love with me. And he told me the cutest thing ever: ""F, it's more than love... lemme explain... you know when you're out sledding all day as a kid, and you come home and you're tired, wet, and cold, and your mom gives you a cup of hot chocolate? THAT's what you make me feel like."" What could I say to that? We talked all night long.. and I went home with someone else that night. Oops. All I have to say to my horrid behavior is... well, why do I keep on hooking up with Bartender when it's SO BAD? I have lots of theories, but the easiest thing right now to write is that I love taming the bad boy in him. Fun.  What else? Some of my buddies are building a fire truck (long story here). but anyways, they got it stuck going up Greene Peak. The snow was 8 feet deep and they couldn't get it out. They had to go up and get it while the snow was frozen, if not it wouldn't pull out through the slush. So, 8 people and 3 dogs piled into two jeeps armed with 28 thousand pounds of pulling capability between the two wenches on the jeeps at 2 in the morning, after we had been drinking since 10. We head up the mountain and some dumbass texans were stuck in the snow. theyw ere in 2-wheel drive. we pop them out of the snow. go further and further up the mountain and there was another two-wheel drive pickupstuck. We get them out of the snow. Then the tough job came. We had to wench our fire truck out. Anyways, won't bore you with the details, but we finally got it out. i helped wench, push, pull  dig snow. I was pretty proud and all the guys thanked me for my help. i had a blast! got home @ 6 am.  what else? mmm... lots of free booze. lots of skiing in short sleeves-- it's so hot, i have an awful farmer's tan! oh yeah, then last night i hooked up with Red Headed Boy. Mmmm... I haven't slept more than 3 hours a night since i've gotten here. We pulled two all-nighters two nights in row. Lots of booze, cigarettes, and hottubs helped.  Dont know what else to say now... oh, funny quote: Bar owner, talking to 2 chicks, ""You two are cut off. Out of the bar."" My buddy Juanito, chugging his beer, ""That's my cue!""  Also, the night bartender  I hooked up, I had a talk with him. Before we ever hooked up this summer, we used to hang out. all was good. Post-hook up, he started acting like an asshole. so when i went back to his house, i told him that if he was going to be an asshole to me that to me it wasn't worth hooking up with him at all. he said he hadn't realized it, and from them on, he's been super-nice. haven't paid for a drink since i got here. oh, the joy of walking around buzzing all day.  been skiing pretty hard-core, too. with the local boys. they really push me. i fell face-first the other day, my first fall in a long time, and the snow now is so sharp, i cut my whole hand and arm. oops. i drank to make the pain go away. also, there was a race in town the other day. locals ""bought"" a racer, and if their racer won, they got money. the auction was to raise money for the kids' racing team in town. a couple of us pooled our money and had 60$ put together to buy my buddy RP, but we were outbid. the funny part is that he raced in a red, flowery SKIRT and my tight, white tank top. When it came time to announce the winners that night, it was funny. ""Best female time, RP, come and get your award!"" haha.  i'll quit boring everyone with my mountain stories. time to go drink anyways!"	f

This is so cool!  I have never done anything like this before.  Just another day in my quest for a new job.  I absolutely cannot go on working at Walmart anymore.  I don't care what I have to do, but I will get out of there one way or another.  They seriously need to learn how to treat people and maybe they wont have such problems keeping associates.  One year is enough for me thank you very much.  So anyway no word yet from JHFCU, but I am keeping my fingers crossed for tomorrow.  On Wednesday I have a test scheduled for another bank, but I really REALLY want JH.  Guess thats all for now.   Jenna	f
Pretty good movie... Loaded with emotional stuff.   The female actor has a non-curable disease, falls for a womanizer, womanizer turns into nice guy, falls in love with the dying lady, some drama and finally a long climax.   Cenrtal Park at NY had been captured beautifully in the movie although this is not the first movie which tried to capture the entire park.   Some characters like female lead's grand ma don't add much value to the movie.  Overall a recommended movie ut I would advice to keep some tissues at hand.  These guys are better than the Indian directors and story writes who for the sake of making audiances happy make an really impossible operation successful and even bring back life to characters in the movie after they have been declared dead. The funny part is it's not the doctors who revive the actor. Most of the time it's other actors' hue and cry that brings back life to the character. If that does not work some deity would be kind enough in the movie so that it grnats life back to the character. The actor gets up from the death bed and goes and kills the bad guys. Great ending.   Actually these guys are also not at fault. The movies where the lead character dies in the end have not been successful at the box office. For instance Dil Se was a disaster at box office. But it was one of the best movies I ever got to see. More about Dil Se later...	m
A phone call from nowhere.  Bryan, aka Bryrox, called me last night at my parents house, leaving a message on my folks machine.  I havent heard from this guy in years.  Always wondered how he was getting on.  A troubled soul, into all sorts of illegal situations from drugs to a history of theft and violence.  His father was a monster, and when he died, he threw a party.  Turns out he was in jail for a spell.  Tackled by the DEA and sent to a 6month stint in a detention facility, followed by a six month residential drug treatment center up in Fresno.  Hes out now, looking to start a new job in Arizona near the Grand Canyon next week.  Part of his punishment, I gather, is to stay away from taking up residence in San Diego for five years.  Shoo the problem away, I suppose.  So, tomorrow we may be having dinner together and catching up.  To hear about his schooling that so excited him, to hear about the family all that has transpired in all this time he has been incommunicado.  No more flutters in my stomach knowing that a night with B means a night with something a lot harder than weed to accompany it.  Just the thought repulses me.	f

"One of the saddest things in this country (Iraq) is that the people have NO clue what freedom of anything is.  Yes they are proud and are slowly learning not to behave so subserviently,  but the last 300 or so years have been under a tyrant or colonial rule.  This hits close to home for me because my family escaped Cuba and ran at all speed to the U.S. starting in 1959 The last of my family came in 1981.  So helping these people begin their lives and nation anew is very exciting and depressing.  Depressing because I see Americans not aware of their fortune in this world.  The poorest person in America has food,  a home,  electricity,  most have cars.  Here they live in 1,000 year old husks of buildings,  have raw sewage running in the street,  barefoot(not by choice) 2 year old children,  and a class of terrorist that kills 100 civilians to soldiers killed.  So what is my complaint,  you are to comfortable.  You complain about the drive-thru,  the cable TV reception,  can't find your damn $150 sneakers in blue,  and voting.  Dozens of countries around the world have had revolutions to do the same thing you complain about doing once a year.  I can bet most of you would not die for the right to vote.  But you bitch all day about Bush,  Clinton,  Nixon (most of you don't know what he did),  the economy,  the environment (come see how others treat their nations resources),  and the war.  I haven't seen many of you here.  An uninformed choice is no choice.  How can you talk about a place or an experience that you have never experienced.  I had a t-shirt when I was in Korea that said ""Korea,  if you ain't been there SHUT THE FUCK UP.""  Everyone will tell you how bad Korea is and have never been there.  Before you start to complain or talk about something get all sides.  I swear to god when I get home the first person I hear complain about not having enough ice in their Coke is getting laid out.  You people better start looking at he rest of the world and seeing how lucky you all are or you will wind up like this place.  Do we as Americans have the right to complain,  of course,  that's part of our revolution.  But seeing a dead child from a terrorists car bomb will make you reassess how much ice you really need in that drink."	m

I have become one of the people I really hate in life. I am one of the people who tell others about their private life. I think I want to tell because of an unconcious thought process of people calling me prude. If I can prove to them that I'm actually doing things, then that wouldn't make them think that. But that's not really it. My other reason for wanting to tell is that it makes it real. If I am the only person who knows what is happenening, other then the guy, then it's just us knowing and ya. I guess it's hard to explain.   Walked at Relay For Life this afternoon since it was cancelled due to storms last night. My dad is coming home soon. Blah. I have a shitload of homework and I don't have any time to do it tomorrow since I'm going to see a play in the evening. Great, the week seems packed already. Band concerts, work, seniors leaving. Tear for that. Among other things. We'll see I guess.	f
100th post. Yay.  Saw Starsky  Hutch yesterday. I pretty much agree with  urlLink Kaimar's  opinion. Pure entertainment, nothing less, nothing more. Reminded me of GTA: Vice City. A new emerging entertainment genre, i suppose. Lots of seventies eye candy and such. They had really paid attention to small details. All the minor stuff you could see in any given scene. I think they might even have overdone it a bit, but it was good nevertheless.	m

"-After going to see a late night viewing of 'The Village', that is the only thing that I am taking away from the movie. This costume, though looking impressive, should be fairly simple to construct. I suspect even someone without any modern conveniences, would be able to make a fairly convincing 'bad color' costume. (eh-he.) I really enjoyed the characters that M. Night developed for this movie...too bad he used them in such a poor story. Fortunately, since I have a ten dollar a week comic book habit, I am used to writers putting good characters in bad stories. (Now, all of you assume I look like Louis Lane [the comic-book guy], on the Simpsons!) That's o.k. Until tonight, I assumed that all of M. Night's movies would be really upsetting, with imaginative twists. If I could get a couple of my friends to run around me, in yellow shawls and parkas...now, that would really be amusing. At least in comic books, good writers can make poor characters seem really imaginative. Superman has been great since Azz' began scripting a few months ago. 100 Bullets has never failed to impress me. GA has survived some of the worst writers -and artists of all time. Daredevil had been recycled for over twenty years, before Bendis took over. I enjoy Hellboy, Sam and Twitch, and even this 'Identity Crisis' in DC...but I still don't look like that fat guy on the Simpsons. -I look far worse. Think -Moe, that guy behind the bar. That guy, dressed in a 'bad color' costume...that is what I look like. Not only am I an ugly character...I am also a poorly written character in a really great story. ""Worst character ever!"""	m
"In Shoaf's latest blog, he vastly oversimplifies the social issues that are in play during the 2004 presidential election.  This is a common mistake that the general population makes all too often.  There are many more social issues at stake than soley ""abortion"" and ""gay marriage"".  If you are deliberating between Bush and Kerry on social issues alone, you also have to ask if you want to have more nanny-state, environmentalist-activist social regulations, such as the cell phone bans which Coleman pointed-out and toilets that won't flush, and you also have to ask whether you want to be subjected to racial preferences, a radical secularist agenda, and ""social justice"" policies out the waazooo.  Kerry is a nightmare on all of these fronts.     Now to digress to the main point of this blog.  The terms ""abortion"" and ""gay marriage"" are ambiguously thrown around much, too much, to do justice to the actual, nuanced debate on more specific issues that exists today.  Where we stand on ""abortion"" and where we stand on ""gay marriage"", would more appropriately be considered where we stand on ""abortion-related policies"" and where we stand on ""gay marriage issues"".  If what you mean by ""abortion"" is overturning Roe, then people need to realize that even with Bush in office, Roe will not realistically be overturned in near future for a number of reasons.  First let's have a little historical background.  Justice Blackmun, a Nixon appointee, wrote Roe.  O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy all Republican appointees vote to uphold it.  A significant percentage of registered Republicans and Republican officials are pro-choice.  The bottom line is that Republican appointees, and Republicans in general are far more pro-choice on the whole than what's written in the Republican platform and just because Bush might get a chance to make some appointments, doesn't mean that his appointments will overturn Roe.   If Bush does get the chance, the most oft-speculated as the next to retire is Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  Rhenquist is the most staunch, pro-life presence on the court, and Bush would have difficulty replacing and would be loath to do so for obvious political reasons. Political concerns, along with Generational and demographic ones, not to mention fervent Senate filibustering, would be exceedingly prohibitive to appointing an equivalent justice.   White House Counsel (Bush's top legal advisor at present) Alberto Gonzalez, who demonstrated pro-choice inklings while presiding on the Texas Supreme Court, is widely considered to be Bush's top choice to fill any court vacancy, and become the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.  Ironically, Bush could very well appoint someone who could acutally strengthen Roe!   Next in line to become Chairman of the Senate Judiciary is Republican R.I.N.O, Senator Arlen Spector from Pennsylvania, who is unabashedly pro-life.  The Chairman and the committee have more influence over nominations than Bush, himself.  This means that, if they don't approve of a Bush appointment, then the appointment is pretty well screwed as evidenced by Miguel Estrada, Charles Pickering, Janice Brown, and the list goes on.  Democrats and ""pro-choicers"" have been applying an ideological litmus test and there is no way that they would let too many, if any, justices through to the Supreme Court, who would upset the balance of the court on this fragile issue to the breaking point.  People need to realize, ABORTION AINT GOING ANYWHERE!!!   Not Only is Roe not in danger, but the court as a body has repeatedly indicated that it is not looking to readdress Roe, regardless of what individual justices think about the abortion.    Again, the bottom line is that the right to an abortion will not be endangered by Republicans or President Bush any time soon, so pro-choiceers can vote for Bush and everyone else can be free to abort as many unwanted preganancies as they so desire.   Why do you you ask then, does John Shoaf and so many other Americans make the mistake of thinking that the basic right to an abortion is in jeopardy?  The answer is the pro-abortion lobby is much, much, more heavily funded and heavily staffed (as compared to the pro-life lobby), and is more widely accepted (though not by any means mainstream).  The pro-abortion lobby and pro-choicers in the media rountinely use scare tactics to cow pro-choicers into voting for Democrats, even though ""Abortion"" is not really at issue.  Without the pro-abortion lobby, Democrats are without one of their most effective lobbies, and without misinforming the public that abortion is constantly ""under-siege"", the pro-abortion lobby is out of a job.  As for what is really at issue, I support everything Bush has done so far reagarding abortion, which could be considered ""pro-life"" initiatives.  He signed the bill to ban 3rd-trimester, partial-birth abortions, the Unborn Victims of Violent Crimes Act to increase the penalties for those who commit crimes against pregnant mothers, has vowed not to employ a litmus tests (as in a pro-life one) on judicial appointments, has upheld the principle that the government shouldn't fund abortions, and has supported a loose form of parental notification for minors.  To the glee of diehard ""pro-lifers"", polls indicate that a majority of Americans also agree with these common sense ""abortion restrictions"", as they are sometimes called.  So in conclusion on the topic of abortion, whether you are ""for"" or ""against"" abortion is not the question you should be asking yourselves.  George Bush is the more logical vote for the vast majority of voters, pro-lifers and common sense pro-choicers alike.  I am for Bush's ""abortion-related policies"" fervently over Kerry's.  Moving on to Gay Marriage.  I take Jonathon Rauch's point of view-that the country's stand on gay marriage should not be coerced by an activist court, but rather left-up to the states and more democratic legislatures and referendums.  As I see it, there are two main issues at stake right now 1) Activist Courts 2) The Proposed Constitutional Ammendment.    The constitutional ammendment is not a threat, because it doesn't stand a chance of being ratified.  Any serious political analyst would agree.  Rather, the ammendment is merely reactionary, posturing, a direct reaction to the activist judges in Massachusetts.    If the ammendment did pass, which it won't, then it wouldn't ""ban"" gay marriage either.  It would merely enunciated that nothing in the Constitution can be interpreted to necessarily allow for gay marriage.  Then, it would again be left-up to states to decide the issue, but this time without the threat of coercive legislation from the bench.  Activist judges on the other hand are threatening, and not just on gay marriage, but also on a whole other wide array of issues.  If we elect Kerry, he will appoint activist judges and that would be very bad.  In conclusion, Elect Bush for two reasons, among many others:  1) He is the logical vote for ""rational"" pro-choicers, like myself.    2) He is better on gay marriage, even if you are accepting of it long term like I am, but realize that you don't want to have the issue dictated to us by some rogue judges in Massachusettes and realize that a new constitutional ammendment to ban it is pie in the sky.  If you have read this far, I thank you and I hope that it gives you new, more informed way of viewing the issues of abortion and gay marriage as they relate to the presidential election.  Vote George Bush in 2004!!"	m

The beast is back on the road! Poor Fiona had a crack in her radiator. That must have been painful for her. But she is fully recovered and back to being my trusty hunk of metal. Just for those of you who were worried.   I got a call about a new job today. I have been trying to find an acceptable new job for about a year. I have had interview after interview and all I ever come up with is CRAP. I really donât want to leave the company that I work for because we are world-renowned and allâŚbut I really donât want to stay at the position that I am in. It is hard work and I have been doing it too long. I just want to get done with school so that I can make REAL money as opposed to this shitty excuse for a paycheck that I am taking home now. Is it so unreasonable to think that I could be hired to do something that might actually pay a decent salary and at the same time, NOT make me hostile and bitter. Nobody wants to be hostile and bitter.   This weekend is the bachelorette party for the wedding that I will be standing in next weekend. I have decided that when I get married, I will pick out the  urlLink ugliest , most expensive freaking dresses that I can find, make these chicks buy them, and hideous shoes to matchâŚones that will give them all blisters the size of their heads, and then on the day of the wedding, I will announce that THIS wedding was the practice one and those were the practice dresses and then show them the real, even more expensive beautiful gowns that my REAL wedding will require. I think that oughtta teach em.	f

"Kill a Middle East head of state, win prizes! - Pentagon shows how By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco  ""Poor people aren't necessarily killers,"" the current President of the United States tells us. ""Just because you happen not to be rich, doesn't mean you're willing to kill.""   Phew! However, the poor now have an additional incentive to take up arms, thanks to an extraordinary initiative from the Pentagon-funded research agency DARPA. Long ago DARPA brought you the Internet, although its more recent windfall has gone on projects that range from the sinister to the whimsical, from Admiral Poindexter's Total Information Awareness surveillance research, to invisible body suits, and a self-healing minefield, complete with winking knight.    urlLink The Register"	m
The Story of N and K  or  A Tale of Two Women  Both and N and K have a odd roles in my life with varying and shifting importance.  The thing is, I don’t know which is more important nor do I know if either is really where I want it or if I’m ready, willing, or able to deal with the consequences of either.  K’s tale  K and I met during the first days of my freshman year of high school.  I was new to the school system and went in with a revamped image, wearing a rock-band t-shirt and a ponytail.  No one knew me, and no one knew any better.  K was in both my English and History class, and she was the cute little blond who was just itching to rebel.  We flirted back and forth for years, finally dating when both of us had it in our schedule the summer before our senior year.  It was a hell of a time, with both of us pushing the terms of friendship, creating deep bonds that have yet to prove completely broken and it’s been nearly nine years.  I was K’s first, or as she would later put it, I ‘stole’ her virginity.  We lasted four months.  Three years later, after a stint of near hatred, in which love was replaced by an equally strong emotion, our lives worked back into each other.  It was the summer before I was going to the Academy and perhaps it was just the right place at the right time, or perhaps I was reeling after coming off of a relationship that had turned out to be much more personally devastating than I’d intended, or perhaps it was just bad luck.  But I took her to Georgia for a wedding and we found love again and launched into a whirlwind for eight of the nine months that we dated.  The last month was much more of disaster recovery than a whirlwind, and there was a great deal of damage.    N’s tale  I met N the first day I was at West Point.  Her room was right next to mine, we were in the same Cadet Basic Training (CBT or ‘Beast Barracks’) squad.  N was like no one I’d ever seen and it took a little while for her to grow on me, and I’m fairly certain that it was the same for her.  Oddly enough, she was the same height as K, whom I had just started dating again at the time.  But that’s where the similarities end.  N was sweet, innocent, virginal, and profoundly religious.   With her room being right next to mine, she’d often come over and just chat, she’d complain about how she missed her boyfriend and I’d complain about how I missed K.  We’d swap stories about what the other had done, or what we’d done for the other and we found solace in missing our significant others together.  Of course, Beast ended and N and I would up in the same academic company, which meant that we’d be around each other in one respect or another for at least the next ten months.  Of course we didn’t see each other too often, with her being busy as a cheerleader and myself being busy hating life at the academy.    Intertwining Tales  Christmas break came and it proved to be the climax of my relationship with K.  It was around that time that I’d decided I didn’t want to stay at West Point and I’d begun to look at other colleges.  At first I’d planned to go to Georgetown, to transfer down there and get a degree in Political Science (the same degree I’d intended to get at West Point), to go back home and be with K and just figure out my life from there.   Then I’d sat down and taken a good look at where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do, nixing Georgetown and instead choosing to stop detouring my life and instead move forward, something I’d only been halfway doing since I’d left my house at eighteen.  This didn’t go over well with K, she saw it as me pushing her away, at running, at making rash decisions.  It wasn’t, not really, I just wanted to move my own life forward.  Regardless, the problems that my career decisions caused with K were completely forgotten over the two weeks or so that I spent with her over Christmas.  It was a time of fervent sex, of tears from her and comfort from me, of wonder and beauty and a closeness that neither of us had felt before.  She’d left expecting a ring shortly, and I’d left thinking that nothing like that couple happen again. I’d left and been swept up in my second semester at West Point.  I knew that if I left before August I’d have to go back to the Army.  Not that I had anything against the Army, but returning was a lot like going to Georgetown, it was a detour from where I knew I needed to go, so I had to really buckle down, to keep my grades up and my head down in order to make it through the semester and the summer so I could resign in peace, one piece.  And second semester hit me much harder than the first had.  It was difficult and it required much more of my time.  K didn’t like this, the closeness that we’d shared over Christmas had not left her, she had become addicted to it, she’d wanted more of it and it had ingrained itself upon her mind in a word that we’d both spoken, marriage.  Add to this that N was once again in the same squad, and things got as interesting as they got scary.  I lost myself in school, lost myself in writing and reading when I wasn’t working, found myself in a terrible depression that I just wanted to be left alone with, and K tried beyond what I could consider normal human bounds to reach me, doing her best to cement herself in my daily life.  That’s a significant task from a thousand miles away, but she did her best.  And as things went down hill, I looked to N for support, because she’d been around for the majority my second relationship with K, at least from my end.  They’d only met twice, once at the first beginning of the academic year, however briefly, and once during the freshman formal, known as Plebe Parent Weekend, which had taken place in October.  But, as things went downhill with K things were going up with N.  I didn’t mean for it to happen, and I told myself I couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t be in a relationship with a cadet, especially one so starkly different than myself, than what I was used to, than what I was looking for, from where I was going.  I certainly couldn’t love her, only I did, and I’m pretty sure that I still do, but that line of friendship has never been crossed.   And then I decided to resign.  I just couldn’t stay at the academy any longer, couldn’t pretend.  I’d been hooked up with a guy who also wanted to write and he dug what I could do.  He wanted me to leave and go to LA with him, to just give it a shot, and frankly, if I could make it, doing what I really wanted to do without spending another few years idle, in a path that would eventually lead me to where I wanted to go, than all the better, right?  The only thing that stood between me and my dreams were about fifteen months, to be spent in the Army.  During that time I cut K out of my life, ended it with her, as painful as she made that, and was close with N, as close as two friends could be, with lines being flirted with but never crossed, as she was already beginning to be taken by another one of our classmates. So I left and went to Texas, a pit stop on my way to Iraq.  While there, I don’t know if it was a need for a relationship, or if N was just being nice, being herself, but those lines we’d been flirting with had vanished.  She’d broken up with the other cadet she’d been seeing and perhaps the two of us were just lonely.  We didn’t agree to anything, there was nothing concrete or formal, no declaration of intent, but the word love was used, if only as closings to letters, email, instant messages, and phone calls.  Turning Burning Wheels  After I got back from Iraq, life once again sought to redefine all of my relationships.  K started talking to me, and after a series of arguments where I told her exactly what I thought about her, her life, and why her life isn’t part of my life, a lot of the tangled strands of burnt bridges that had existed between us were swept away.  Now it’s just odd, now I’m a confidant, someone she wants in her life.  N is stuck in a very similar spot I was a year ago, stuck with the weight of the academy pushing down on her.  She’s changed a bit, still very nice, but with a certain sense of cold, of cynicism that’s always bred the second year at the academy.  She works very hard, and I know that the amount of work she’s facing at school.  I try and understand, to be considerate, but I’m left wondering that since there’s no longer seven thousand miles separating us, whether the ease of communication is what perhaps has stinted what we had before.  It might be fear, it might be school, it might just be that she’s moved on and she’s seeing someone else.  But what I’m confronted with is two opposite situations.  The first is with K, where I’m relating more than I want to with one person, and the other with N, where I feel I’m not relating enough.  I’ve sworn off marriage, not wanting to do so for at least a good while.  I’m not even looking for a relationship until I get out to LA, to meet someone out there, to look for the diamond in the roughest of roughs.  And all that aside, I still wish I was closer with N.  Maybe it’s because she was there for me when I needed her, maybe it’s because I love her, or maybe because somehow I feel she’s stronger than me, and in life we all flock to those stronger than us.	m

How Appropriate...   This update was supposed to go up last night, but...I sort of fell asleep without actually going to sleep, if you know what I mean. Appropriately, it rained all day yesterday, and the night before that, which makes it sound suspiciously like MoR's backstory. It was also a no-subbing day (as today appears to be as well, woo-hoo!), which made it more or less ideal for getting things done. And get things done I did; the tile selection pallete and drawing tool work now, which is kind of a big deal, at least you can draw grass smiley faces on the map now. It's still ugly as sin, but that's the tileset's fault. I also worked a bunch on the design document, chewing through three quarters of the section outlining MoR's four pillars of gameplay (which I have delineated as Combat, Character Development, Exploration/Impact, and Story Development).   Here's the goal for today: on the code side I'd really like to implement level saving in the editor, and level loading in the 2D engine. The in-progress version of the game is going to not use a single-file organization to represent all the information in the game module; rather, it will have individual files for each level, and all levels in a given directory will comprise the module. All the relevant module scripts will reside in this directory too.  On the content side the goal is to generate two or three non-ugly tiles. These can then be used to show screenshots without having to hang my head in shame :-) I'm thinking I'll start off with the all mighty grass tile, and then add a couple boulder/twisted stone formation tiles. This is all I'll need to make the Arena map for testing out Combat mechanics.  I'll try to put up a note tonight outlining how I did.	m

' but how is it secret if you're talking about it on the internet, where the entire computer-literate world can read about it, you dumbass?

I'm so sad.  The tops of my feet are covered in misquito bites.    It's not bareable.  It's 6 am, and I'm awake because my feet itch.

So I am up, Hydrocortisone in hand- (or- on foot, actually).  This is a terrible situation.	f
"Lately I've been reading (among other things)  urlLink N. T. Wright's  ( urlLink another Wright link ) landmark work on the resurrection,  urlLink The Resurrection of the Son of God .  I'm still working through this book (hoping to finish it before the semester starts), but already I can see why Wright is a significant cut above the rest of scholarship.  First, he writes with clarity.  Moreover, he brings clarity to a large sampling of data.  For example, he distinguishes five meanings of the word ""history,"" so when he critiques others or uses the word himself, there is no doubt what he is getting at.  Wright is generous to contemporary scholarship, but quick to point out how his peers are imprecise with their analysis.  Another real strength in Wright's work is his prolific background in other disciplines.  He goes between the worlds of Homer, Plato, Virgil, Moses, Isaiah, Daniel, Antiochus, Jesus, and Paul demonstrating expertise.  Once again, he regularly brings clarity to these gargantuan and clouded issues.  A final word of praise I will mention in this post is that the apparent impetus behind his work is getting to the primary sources.  Wright is concerned with answering questions that address the origins of these beliefs.  Why did Christianity continue powerfully despite the death of its leader?  Why did the earliest Christians believe what they did?  Wright skillfully shows how many modern scholars present intriguing insights, but fail to answer significant questions like these.  Moreover, by focusing on primary sources, Wright regularly shows that scholarship goes awry when it disregards a wealth of information that sheds precious light on the people and world from which these ideas originated.  For those unfamiliar with N. T. Wright, I urge you consider making yourself acquainted with his work."	m

...and we will start with our downstairs bathroom. Beck and I got crazy with the cheese whiz last night and painted the bathroom. It's tiny but we did a total make over.  1930 hrs...  Wash all the walls with TSP (cleaner).  Paint all the walls (medium gray).  Hang little cabinet over toilet (white with mirror in it).  -----  0000 hrs...  Go to bed.  -----  Today...  Buy and install new fancy towel rack and matching TP holder (white and chrome).  Buy and hang up new towels (maroon and white)  Buy some spray paint and paint small ledge shelf (white).  Hang small shelf.  -----  Still need to do...  Buy maroon bath rug to match all the other colors.  Buy chrome hand soap pump thingy.    Side note... when the can of spray paint says to use in temps between 65 and 85 degrees you should do it (unless you live in hell like me where it never gets to 85 in the summer). When it is over 108 degrees outside (in the shade) spray paint can easily dry in the time it takes the paint to leave the can and reach whatever you are painting. This makes for a fun painting experience. The up side to it drying so fast is that there is no over spray problems because the paint is dry before it hits anything (like the quads). Sweet.   That is the latest happenings.  ST off to sniff some of that great spray paint.	m
Well - that cinches it - the world is coming to an end. Here I am writing on this blog two days in a row.            I am suppose to be putting together three shelves but I am being a bum - besides I have to keep an eye out for the kittens. We are letting them outside with the new puppies and anyone who has ever had this many animals ( 7 dogs and 15 cats)knows things don't go smoothly. My little (LEO) - who has been one sick kitty since April = caught a baby bird this morning - needless to say the mocking birds are pissed - so was I. The last thing I need is for him to eat some raw bird and get sick again. I tried to rescue the bird but I don't know if it worked and I know NOTHING about Birds. So I set it free once I gotit out of his mouth and I went to check on it and it wasn't where I left it so MAYBE it's okay.So far the only thing that has gone right this morning is my internet connection miraculously got better.	f

"A mayoral debate   Who brings their children to a municipal debate?  Honestly.     We attended the CBC Radio One mayoral debate: ""Your Next Mayor"" at the Glen Gould studio on Monday Night.  The audience included a lot of tweedy intellectual-types, old people, us, and a 10 year old kid sporting a note pad, sitting beside his old, tweedy, intellectual-type parents.  My girlfriend noted ""Oh, he's probably doing a report or something for school.""  I thought ""Man, that kid's gonna get beaten up at school tomorrow"".  The outcome of the debate?  Have you ever heard Barbara Hall speak?  It's not an entertaining event.  In my humble opinion, Miller came out ahead.  He answered questions in a fair and reasonably straightforward fashion.  He did what candidates are supposed to do in a debate, and that's to clarify and defend his position on the issues.  Tory was also a high point of the evening.  The only candidate (at the debate) who has never held a political office, Tory seems to clearly understand the process, the issues, and can provide reasonable arguments for why his solutions will solve our problems.  Jakobek and Nunziata stood their ground firmly on some of the ""unpopular"" platform planks, and should be commended for their resolve.  The problem with these two candidates in particular was their tendencies to wander away from the question, speak on a campaign pillar, and then loosely tie their answer back to the original question.  Nunziata for example was asked about how, in practical terms, he would increase affordable housing in the City.  He spoke about homelessness, and how he would provide compassionate care to people who need our help.  Which brings us to Ms. Hall.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and compare her, to George W. Bush.  We may have to evoke an adjusted clause of Goodwin's Law....  Hall speaks, like Bush speaks.  There was an observation (in this  urlLink book  if I remember correctly) that all of those little ""Bushisms"" were caused because Bush was speaking on a subject that he had no interest in or didnt fully understand.  Bushisms like ""Reading is the basics for all learning"" and ""You're working hard to put food on your family"" only seemed to occur when Bush spoke about ""compassionate"" things (family, education, social services, etc).  But when he spoke about a subject that he was passionate about, invading Iraq or corporate tax breaks for instance, all those little flubs and ""Bushisms"" seemed to disappear, and he spoke like a statesman.  Suddenly he could think on his feet, and answer novel questions.   Hall seemed to suffer from the same problem on Monday night.  When asked how she will deal with the provincial government, she had party line statements like ""I will fight for a new deal and I will get that new deal from the province"".  When pressed for specifics, it was as though she lost her train of thought mid-sentence and filled her answer with random statements like ""red tape"" and ""work with council"" and ""look at alternatives"".  However, when asked (the final question of the night) about racialized poverty in the city, suddenly she became passionate again and delivered a clear answer.  My girlfriend noted that Hall and Miller generally phrased their responses using terms like I will work with and examine all positions on the matter, while the other candidates used more individually decisive terms like I will make and I will change.  This morning Star columnist  urlLink Royson James  analyzed the debate and noted an issue that wasnt addressed in the debate to any satisfaction:  The fact is, Toronto faces a fiscal nightmare scenario that will greet the new mayor with a budget shortfall approaching $100 million. It has debt levels that are too high, reserve funds that are too low, infrastructure that's old and crumbling and is underfunded by as much as $300 million a year.  Yet, to hear the candidates, they'll just march into city hall and uncover waste and inefficiencies worth millions."	m
Alrighty guys – here's a website I wish we had for Australia…  Its  perfect match for politics ...  I had a go, thought about it, and answered honestly.  My top 6 candidate matches were Democrat (no surprise there) with the apparent preference order going like this:  Sharpton 100% match Kuchinich 94% Kerry 93% Clark 92% Dean 91% Edwards 83% And for the record Bush 33%	m
"Well, the BBQ was a success (and my dad was completely surprised to find out that it was a retirement party in his honor), though of course we are exhausted. I didn't sit down for more than 10 minutes most of the day, nor did I get too much time to chat and catch up with any of the 45 or so family that were here, but I think everyone knows that I'm not pg yet and we're still trying.  Funny how that manages to make its way into every conversation, even when I'm NOT obsessing (really, I'm not!) -- sometimes I wonder if I make people uncomfortable with the things I say, but then I kinda think ""fuck it"" -- I AM going to talk about the miscarriages and I AM going to talk about how much I want a baby. I don't think I talk about it too much...at least most of the time. Most people know the situation and most tend to ask in some kind of way.  I also was able to squeeze in a little bit of bonding time with my little 3-month-old nephew. He is just so damned cute. He really is. I love holding him, I love changing his little diapers, I love feeding him, and I love that the ceiling fan or my fingers twirling makes him light up and coo. He is just so damned cute. Have I mentioned how much I want a baby of my own?! Some day...I am really tring to be patient and have faith that it will happen for us.  I'm very bummed that it is now officially Sunday afternoon and the weekend is almost at an end. I don't know where weekends go. My best friend is also visiting this weekend, and I had the best time with her and DH last night, when I drank far too much wine but had so much fun being silly-ass drunk and up 'till 3am with two of my favortie people in the world.  I am so grateful for the many wonderful people in my life. How did I get so lucky? I am very fortunate, and sometimes I need a little reminder. Family and friends gathered around me tends to help me remember that I am very fortunate, and I am loved.  Okay, enough of the mushiness. (God I am becoming more and more of a sap every day...I'm not quite sure when that happened.) I need some more coffee..."	f
Olympics are in full swing! Yippee! No, Phelps isn't doing what the media predicted, and YES, he  is  living up to expectations. If you don't know much about swimming, then you will believe all the media hype and absurd predictions. Yes, it would have been nice, but y'all have to realize that he is already the best swimmer in the US and that is a HUGE feat unto itself. He is also pretty well-rounded, swimming different strokes and different distances. The swimmers who are beating him specialize in one or two events and that's pretty much all they swim. And remember, this guy is only 19. Can you imagine what a powerhouse he will be in four years? Iam Thorpe really seems to be peaking NOW, not in Sydney, when he was target of all the hype and didn't sweep his events.    In other swimming news, Yana   Klochkova is moya tyolka! Slava Ukrainu!	f

"Yo Yo Yo...Well kids it time to get this blog train rolling again and with not to much to say I think it will stop right in the middle of the track(dont think that made since) but anyways I got out of class about 30 min ago, I think Im starting to like Mr. Kuljac a.k.a Mr. Kick the problems ass...He is really good at explaining things and although I rarely need help(not bragging im just gifted haha) hes really good but anyways I guess the last time i blogged was thurs day Its been almost a whole week well lets see, this past weekend is what comes to mind, i went to san fran with Chels and Sadia the ""oreo"" and we were with the Renegades all day and to say the least it was incredible I dont think i regret anything from that weekend except wearing black clothes. So yea ummm sunday ""B"" Corps as usual we got some new songs and things to work on but its starting to come a little routine so Im used to it now... It is still the highlight of my weeks but being with the Renegades on sunday was amazing so i dunno i was kinda drum corps out but i did get a compliment from Shawn on my marching which was kinda cool. But this weekend we dont have to go so by next weekend ill be ready again. (if that made since), so im not too excited about my long weekend, on fri i have mucho music rehearsals for hawaii and for barbershop. FUN? i think not! On sat im singing to people and hanging out with Sadia, (not too excited bout sat, lets just say there something that I really dont want to do to someone) but ill leave it at that. Sun nothing due to the ""B"" corps break which means ill either sit at home or the ""OREO"" will strike yet again. Then monday dunno..the story of my life. So yea I will ttyl IM me sometime cya"	m
"71. I own two evening gowns that I have never worn.  I own these evening gowns because I am a person who engages in a practice I like to call, ""Wishful Clothes Shopping.""  The rules of ""WCS"" are as follows: 1) You must have absolutely no practical need for the item you are considering buying.  2) The item must be absurdly expensive.  Not  insanely  expensive, just absurdly so.  For those of you having trouble determining the difference, an  absurdly  expensive item causes you to say something like, ""I can afford to buy this if I eat only Ramen for the next several weeks.""  An  insanely  expensive item causes you to say something like, ""I can afford to buy this if I pick up some extra pocket change by robbing the homeless.""  3) The item must inspire an irrational and elaborate fantasy sequence that ends with the sentence, ""And then he will realize he loves me.""  For example, ""Oooh.  Look at this $250 red cocktail dress.  I have no need for a cocktail dress.  My boyfriend has not ever invited me to cocktails.  But,  if he did invite me to cocktails  this is the dress I would like to wear.  I can see it now: he will call me up spontaneously from his office.  His friends, he will say, are meeting him for drinks after work, and he would like me to come.  Can I be there?  Of course, I will say.  Then I will go to my closet, put on  this  red cocktail dress, which I will be GLAD I purchased.  I will walk into the bar.  The skirt of this red cocktail dress will swish a lot, and men in top hats will escort me down a winding staircase.  At the bottom of which photographers will gather to take my picture.  My boyfriend will be standing just outside the crowd of flashing cameras.  His friends' mouths will be open in amazement.  That's your girlfriend? they'll say.  Yes, he will say.  And--though he didn't before--suddenly, because of  this red cocktail dress , he will realize he loves me.""    For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about (probably men, mostly), it may be easier to understand WCS if you think back to the last time you bought sporting equipment.  You've not played soccer in five years.  And you sure could use the closet space that these shin guards and shoes would be taking up.  But, what if the guys call you up, say, this weekend and ask you to play? How cool would you be if you showed up wearing  these  awesome Nike soccer shoes?  How much better would your game be?  And so on.    72) For those of you who DO know what I'm talking about, take the number of Wishful Clothes Shopping items you've purchased.  Multiply it by seven.  Now you're in the ballpark with the number of Wishful Clothes Shopping items  I've  purchased.  Hold on a second, someone just gave the homeless guy over there a quarter....  73) I only set alarms for times that end in ""six.""  For example, If I am supposed to wake up at 8:00, I will set my alarm for 8:06.    74)  My favorite number is 1236.  I like it because it contains beautiful symmetries and patterns.  One being half of two and three being half of six.  Twelve going into thirty-six three times.  One times two is two, times three is six.  Etc.  Pretty, pretty, pretty.  75)  At important times in my life--i.e. when big changes are occurring, or something major is just around the corner--I automatically wake up in the middle of the night when the clock reads ""1:11,"" ""2:22,"" etc.     76)  Whenever I go to the top of anything very high (buildings, bridges, etc.) I have an almost overwhelming urge to drop something over the edge.  ""Something"" does not mean pennies or a pen cap.  ""Something"" means my keys.  My purse.  When I used to wear them, it meant my glasses.  I surreptitiously dangled my glasses over the ledge of the tower window of many a castle in Germany in my day.  Also from observation decks all over the United States.  It still makes my hands sweat with the temptation and risk of it.  77) I'm good at speaking and spelling things backwards.  .sdrawkcab  At a certain point in my life, I was obsessed with speaking backwards.  When I was going through this phase, I was much older than you're probably thinking I was.  No one understands you when you talk backwards, no matter how good you are at it.  Trust me.    78) There is a physical feeling that happens to me everytime I am lonely.  I feel it in my chest and my upper arms.  As though someone is drawing my blood with a needle from the inside.  Reverse misquitos.  It makes me remember filling the shirtsleeves of our scarecrow with cornhusks and prickly pieces of hay.    79) I love it when people notice a tiny black speck in the skin of my right hand.  I still have a piece of lead stuck there from where Maggie Bogenreef stabbed me with a pencil when I was nine.  80) I like seeing how far I can walk with my eyes closed.  I do it all the time in hallways and on emptier stretches of sidewalk.  Right now my record is forty-two steps."	f

WHAT?  he was going on and on how he has money and hes a BLACK man or something, and i was like, uh..thats nice..edging..edging...then he starts to count his money and like he was already up to a grand with just like a small portion of the bills! damn he had money! i think walter was giving him like dirty looks cuz then this guy was like, i dont think that guy likes me and walter was like, this is my friend can i help you? and the guy was like mumblemumble but he wouldnt leave...im still edging closer and closer to the next seat...finally will comes back and is like, can i help you...i think the guy wanted to shake wills hand or something, i was too preoccupied with edging away...and he was like this ur man? and i was like, yes! and will was like, can i help you, my girlfriend is trying to get some quiet time to study..and the guy just went on and on about how will is a lucky man and whatevers, and was like you are beautiful have you thought about optometry (i was wearing glasses instead of contacts)...so finally the owner this young asian guy comes and manages to get him away, but it was tough like he had to almost like physically drag him out...which reminds me so strange- like if he had so much money, he opened this plastic bag he was carrying to show me that he had like one of those little chinese food takeouts- and inside was just rice...STRANGE...yah so finally he left.  that was strange.  we came home around 11ish, i studied till like 4, tried to sleep, had a bad dream- something about like kareen getting me in trouble with the law- like kind of CSI-ey where they were finding clues that made me look guilty but i wasnt!  so didnt sleep well, woke up at like 8 and studied more, class 11-1230 then worked on ee126 hmwk till 330; then lecture 330-5- where i got my midterm back- i didnt do as badly as i thought, i thought i was goin to get like a 30 or something, but i got like a 50.  ha ha.

yeah, yesterday was pretty hectic. didnt do this then cuz i was too tired. but yeah, got  up real early and was at the train station by 7:45 to head down to chicago. got down there and we realized there was an hour wait for the next train that we needed to catch to head to brookfield zoo. so we walk around union station for an hour and eventually hop on the train. now, the zoo told me we need to get off at the brookfield stop (make sense doesnt it?) but as we hit the stop BEFORE brookfield (hollywood) we realize theres all these signs for the zoo. so were like 'uh oh.' we get off at brookfield and walk around the whack little intersection for a bit and finally head into a store to ask for directions. it turns out that hollywood and brookfield are about a minute apart via train. but to actually walk from the brookfield stop to the hollywood stop takes forever cuz theres no streets. you gotta go all the way around. so this guy ends up drawing us a map to the zoo and we set off walking for what seems like forever. after like an hour we thought we turns the wrong way down one of the streets cuz we didnt find the school we were supposed to see. but then, out of nowhere, appeared school crossing signs so we knew we were close. ended up gettting to the zoo at like noon. 2.5 hrs behind schedule. lol. we got in there and started walking around looking at stuff. went underground to watch the dolphins for a while. i think we looked at them for longer than any other animal. after trying for like 15 mins to get a good picture i finally gave up. everytime  they swam by the glass, some dumb lady got up and kept sticking a mirror on the glass. i have no idea what she was doing. it was really odd though and she kept ruing my pictures :( after that we just started seeing exhibits one by one. we kinda lingered around bears and such for the first part of the day. there was this fragile kingdom thing set up in three sections. there was desert, forest, and then the big cats. it was cool but most of the animals were just sitting there not doin too much. still cool to see though. after that we saw the dolphin show which lasted for a shorter amount of time than we were waiting for it. we sat there for like 30 mins waiting and it was only like 20mins long. lame. -shrug- they did cool stuff though so it was alright. the gorillas and other monkeys in the tropic world were pretty cool. we watched them for a while. habitat africa was enormous. it was three sections that took up the entire northwest part of the zoo. there were like 8billion okapi things. lol. and then giraffes which we cool. we saw the trainer people talk about how they feed them, etc. after that it was something around 4ish id say. we went to sit down and eat lunch for like ten mins and then we raced off to see everything we hadnt seen yet. we stopped by the elephants and such which, in my opinion, were kinda boring. they just stood there for a good while. yeah. then we finally found the reptile house and the swamp which we managed to pass by about fourty times. went in there and i think those animals were the coolest ones. there were all these huge lizards and snakes and such. it was like wheres waldo trying to find all them in their cages cuz they just sat there and blended in. heh. the living coast was fun too. that was the last thing we did. there was this big building devoted to the underwater/costal animals. so there were penguins and seagulls and such just flying/waddling around. there were also these footlong centipeded. blah. gross. but yeah, that pretty much rounded out our day at the zoo. it was like ten to six at this point so we go into a shop and ask someone how to get to the hollywood train station. it turns out, it was like a ten minute walk. how much does that suck huh? so we walk the ten mins it takes to get to the station and sit there for an hour and a half waiting for our train to come to take us back to union station. there were the weirdest people there. well at the zoo too. there was this fifty year old lady whos butt hung out of her shorts. it was thoroughly disgusting. and then the eighty year old in short shorts and a tube top. her boobs dragged the ground. no lie. it was nasty. and there were about 400 amish people there. no lie. it was pretty funny. beard, hats, suspenders, etc. all the kids had the exact same haircut. all the girls wore these little hats. it was weird. we ran into them about five hundred times. the same ones. hehe. then the people at the hollywood station going back. omg. these two girls decide theyre gonna take off their shoes and run around in the middle of the three lane train tracks. i was like 'omg you retards move' and then a train comes and their dad is yelling at them to move their asses. and theyre like 'i dont see a train. where?' little did they realize it was coming behind them. so they move with about five seconds to spare and the train comes flying by at like 80. scared the hell outta me. lol. then we move to the other side of the tracks cuz we realize the train we need to get on comes from the other way. so we do, and theres this annoying guy who decides he has to try out every single ring tone on his phone for everyone to hear. then, out of nowhere, he starts making elephant noises for like ten minutes. thank god, the train came shortly. we got on, rode it back to union station. once there we find out the train back to bartlett doesnt leave til like 8:40. so we have a good hour or better left. we sat around til the train came, got on and had a hell of a time findind seats. we walked to the far end of the train to get some and even then, our car filled up really fast. the train back to btown took like, an hour or so. we pulled in at 9:40. i was home by like ten and dead tired. talk to anna on the phone for a bit and went to sleep. i was exhausted. in a fit of sleepyness i set my alarm for 8 thinking id have to be at work today by 9:30. i misjudged. i really have to be there at 11:30. so ive had three hours to just sit around doing nothing. gotta work til 5 something today and then im prolly gonna do something with anna afterwards. its 11:05 now. gotta roll soon. guess im done here.	m

"*sigh of relief* ah, life has returned to it's normal pace. I finally have time to post here. All last week I had a show/a rehearsal, and so I really didn't have time for much of anything. But! The show is over! And things are fine.   The shows went pretty well! I was most happy to finally have people see my show, and to finally have people understand me when I was saying ""This is a ______."" ""A what?"" ""A ______."" And ""Well now, hear this! I... Have no left hand. The weakest show was probably the Saturday matinee... Who's used to doing a show at like 2pm? Energies were low. and my voice was scratchy from this cold I'm getting over, so I didn't do that great. But that night was great! I made more errors that night then the day performance... but energies were better! So it was all around a better show.

"I saw ""Lost In Translation"" this evening.  Along with just 9 of the 170 reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes, I wasn't thrilled.  ""Dreadfully boring,"" were my words, I think, which may be unfair.

Some really good things happened in London and environs today. And some horrid things too.   A couple of lovely things:  The li'l tykes had their exams today , meaning that I didn't have to teach AT ALL. Which in turn means that I have finished my KS3 essay, although it is unmitigated shite. Some kids were vaguely perturbed that I am leaving. Aw. Nice things happened to good people.   And the not so lovely:  I got myself all upset and befuddled about the Summer. I literally had six days left unaccounted for such was my workload. After seeking advice from, well, everyone, I decided to pull out at short notice from the summer work I got ages ago. Meaning that the people involved now hate me. Justifiably, given that I've dropped them in the shit a bit. The teacher who asked me to do it in the first place is v v angry at me. *sobs pathetically*  This is nothing to get upset about, right? So I've pissed off a few people I'll never see again after tomorrow. It is difficult to be a let down. But! I have cleared a full three weeks of my schedule. Am so so relieved.  TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY IN MY PLACEMENT SCHOOL.	f

"As a 25 year old living in America today, I can't tell you how happy I am to not have had to grow up with Walter Cronkite.  Yes yes, I realize for most boomers he was ""the news""--but darn it, I don't like the idea of all my news coming from ONE GUY.  Regardless of how personable or fatherly he might be.   So thank goodness I didn't have to grow up with Walter Cronkite."	m

"Oh glory be, I got REM sleep last night. I actually dreamed! I woke up once or twice during the night, I think, but I know for a fact that I slept at least four hours straight and that I dreamed during that period. I slept more after that as well.  Holy cow I feel like a new person. Stress sucks balls, primarily because it interferes with sleep.   I could cry, I'm so relieved. I can focus. I can concentrate. I don't ache all over. I tried taking benadryl the other night and that didn't help. Last night, I drank a few mugs of chamomille tea. That, on top of the fact that I was deliriously tired, actually helped me start catching up on sleep. I know I need another full night of hard sleep with no waking up, so maybe I'll tack on the melatonin tonight, like   urlLink Dave  suggested.  Speaking of Dave...big, huge best of luck to you and your fellow Linuxheads with  urlLink Specifix Linux .  Now, in other news...  I have little sympathy for  urlLink this man .  ""LOXAHATCHEE, Florida (CNN) -- A 600-pound tiger owned by an actor who once portrayed Tarzan was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon, a wildlife official said.""  The owner of the tiger says the tiger was sleeping and the officers shot him without cause. ""Asked why officers took lethal force, he told CNN, ""They want glory. They want to be able to say, *We killed the tiger. We are the winners. We did our job. We saved the people from this vicious tiger*."" The officer says the animal lunged at him.   Just two years ago, this same tiger injured a woman who was working for the tiger's owner. ""She was on the ground and looked like something unusual. All he did was grab her. It does not take very much for the fangs to penetrate human skin.""  She was just lying on the ground, huh? Doesn't take much for the fangs to penetrate skin, huh? Sounds like a dangerous animal. The officials acted in the public's best interest, I'd say. I'm sorry the tiger is dead--they are beautiful animals--and I'm sorry for the man's loss, but he obviously wasn't being a very good wild animal owner to begin with if he allowed the beast to get loose. I say he learned a tough but reasonable lesson. Tigers are not domestic beasts. Never were meant to be. Never will be. You can't treat an escaped tiger like you'd treat a tabby cat stuck in a tree.  If anything, I think the owner should be charged for neglecting his animal (the owner's negligence ultimately resulted in the animal's death), as well as endangering the public."	f
"+Sorry, publishing is temporarily unavailable+   Sunday.. Fahmy's open house. I think I got there close to 4pm, found a table and attacked the buffet. Well, not really attacked.. but I did indulge in some *ugh* oily stuff. The chicken was yummy, I loved that one. After a plate of bits of this and that, I stuck to fruits and water. Shakhira called and said she was coming over, so I thought I'd eat again with her. She turned up, but I decided to pass on a second helping. After some recalculating, I realized I had like 6 sticks of  sate . Bloody hell.. and I'm supposed to be on a diet. Oh well, atleast I got rid of the center fat part. I'm not even gonna try to explain that. Oh, and Wafi turned up later that evening. I think it was after 6pm, he was from another house. After all of Fahmy's friends left, it was just me, Shakhira, Fahmy and Wafi at the table. Yada yada yada.. We left around 7.40pm or something. I was supposed to go to this other house for dinner with the family.  I skipped the dinner and stayed home instead.  For a while, anyway  *Hehe* I watched TV for a bit, while eating that yummy chicken (I'm such a glutton). Good thing I still have a little bit of sense and it was a tiny piece. *Wheww!* After a half hour of TV, I called Shakhira to see what she's up to. She was gonna to meet up with some of the girls for dinner, I didn't go 'cuz of that dinner I was supposed to go to. They're still there, but Shakhira said she's leaving and that she's coming over to pick me up. I had to rush and get changed.  We had to drop by her apartment for her to get changed and get some stuff. We asked Wafi to join us in Bangsar, if he's free. As usual, we went to  urlLink BarFlam  for drinks. Shakhira was still hungry, so she ordered the sauteed prawns. I held back, but I did snack on the peanuts Anas (a waiter there. Cute one *heh*) brought over. It was just the 2 of us, hanging around talking about this and that. Didn't think Wafi was gonna turn up because everytime  he says ""I'll see how it goes"", it means no *hehe*  He called around 11.30pm, we have just told the waiter to keep the bottle and getting ready to leave. Shakhira went to the loo, and Anas was asking why we're leaving so early. I was talking to him when my phone rang. Wafi was asking where in Bangsar were we, I told him and asked if he's coming. He said he'll call me back, so okay.. I went back to our table and told Shakhira. We were finishing our drinks when Wafi turned up. Heh. He was already in Bangsar when he called. The bottle was brought back out, we hung out for a little bit more. Around midnight Wafi said he had to go, so we sent the bottle away and left. I got home around  12.30am and crashed right away.  Yesterday was nothing but food and sleep. I got up around 10.30am, had breakfast. A sinfull, fatty breakfast. Watched a movie and then fell asleep around lunch time. Finally dragged my ass outta bed around 5.45pm, showered and went to hunt for food. Found my mom in the kitchen about to eat, so I joined her. More oily stuff into my mouth. I don't recall what I did after that, but I went out with my friends around 8.45pm. Had dinner with Shakhira and then met up with the rest around 9.30pm. Got teased mercilessly, couple of drinks, reached home around 11.30pm, hung out, babbled on the phone and crashed.  Boy, oh boy.. What exciting life I lead *GAG!*"	f

happy 420 everyone!!  thats all..	f
seriously. don't get me started.  seriously.   well look, it's like this. i find haircuts traumatic; possibly moreso than most things in my life. if that sounds odd, consider this. i have never - ever - in my life received a haircut that i was happy with. content, even. not one. ever. i am twenty five; having been alive for a quarter of a century, how many haircuts do you suppose i have had? how many have you had? i haven't liked a single one of them. not one.   let me elaborate. haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers; it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut, or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane. so then you decide to get it cut, and things get serious. what cut do you want? how do you want to appear to the rest of the world? i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring 'yes, i paid money to look this specific way'. and why do i hate that idea? i pay money to dress the way i do, to go the places i do, so what's the difference? ah, good question, and the answer is one of life's little secrets: hairdressers never do what you ask them to. they only ever do *what they were going to anyway*. it makes no matter what you say to them, you will only ever leave the shop when *they* are happy that you look like they want you to. we are helpless; once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over, and we never get it back. we are at the mercy of the hairdresser; someone, you'll note, who invariably has hair that you personally wouldn't be seen dead with. strange, that, eh? yes its true, whatever you ask for you're leaving looking 'trendy'.  or even worse, as happened to me last time: having an interview the next day i asked to look 'sensible'. i actually came out looking 'like i was in the marines'. tossers. (hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.	m

Been hanging out with Susan everyday, riding my bike, and just messing around on the internet. I havent managed to update this site though. Im a slacker.   Anyhow, Kyles Bday is tomorrow and we are headed down to Ocala to ride the skatepark there for a while. Its gonna kick ass! I have been since his bday last year which was super fun. It should be an interesting trick considering we are both a hell of alot better since then.   The first week of August me, Susan,  my mom are headed down to Tampa to spend the week and chill down there. That should be awesome. Cant wait to just get away from it all and spend a week at the beach. Maybe get a tan...lol.   School starts again August 16th which blows really bad because I hate school and really dont want to go, but Im going to have to do good this year since I slacked off last year alot. Oh well, we will see what happens.   Until Next time. Later.   I LOVE YOU SUSAN!!!	m
"I promised someone an essay on Goethe and I haven't come up with anything yet. But  urlLink here is an excellent article  surveying Goethe's life and works. Note especially that his  Sturm und Drang  period was prior to even the birth of most of the English Romantics, and that the German Romantic movement was named in opposition to Goethe and Schiller's Classicism. So why is Goethe considered a Romantic by most English majors and even some textbooks? You tell me.  From the article, I put together a chronology of Goethe's works.   1773Goetz of Berlichingen - A play about a Medieval hero with a (literal) iron hand. 1774 The Sorrows of Young Werther -The ultimate Romantic novel of unrequited love. 1775Faust: A Fragment - The core of Faust's romance and wager.  1787Iphigenia in Tauris - Goethe's ultimate classical play, about the   triumph of honesty, strength and ethics over adversity. 1789Torquato Tasso - A play about an Italian playwright who represents all   poets. 1789Roman Elegies - Poems, some off-color, written while in Italy. 1790The Metamorphosis of Plants - Attempt to discover a primal form in various plants. 1794Reynard the Fox - Fable of the utility of cunning. 1795Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship - A  Bildungsroman : an novelistic   account of the cultural education of a young man.  1795Conversations of German Refugees 1798Hermann and Dorothea - A classical poetic epic of a German couple. 1809Elective Affinities - A romantic and tragic novel about partner   switching and a mystical scientific principle.  1810Theory of Colors - An attempt to ""save the phenomena"" of light   and an attack on Newton's very well established optic theory. 1811-33     From My Life: Truth and Poetry - One of the first psychologically   literate autobiographies, not unlike Rousseau's  Confessions . 1816Italian Journey - An autobiographical account of Goethe's flight from literary celebrity into the land that is the inspiration for Goethe's classical period. 1819West-Eastern Divan - The first book of world literaure, a book of poetry including many homages to eastern writers including Mohammad, Rumi, and Hafiz.  1821         Wilhelm Meister's Travels - Continuation of the  bildungsroman  and a ready vehicle for Goethe's opinions.  1832Faust, Part Two - Faust has more symbolic, mythic and bizarre poetical adventures. 1836Conversations with Goethe - The conversations of Goethe's last ten   years, arranged by date and recorded more or less accurately by Goethe's assistant, Eckermann."	m
"Vacation has officially started, and it is definitely summer.  It was somewhere in the mid 90s the last 2 days, and it is supposed to hit 95 tomorrow again.  Since I'm unemployed and not doing much else this summer, I've decided to take up jogging again, this time with the help of my lovely girlfriend.  Tomorrow the trek begins at 6:30 am.  We'll see how it goes.  We'll start at 3x a week, but maybe it will progress into more.  It's good I guess.  It keeps your heart healthy, and burns away some of that weight you want to get rid of or whatever.  So I will be going to bed shortly in order to get enough rest for my early rise tomorrow.  I also plan on selling back some old cds to my friend  CD World , and hopefully get enough credit to buy some new cds.  Here's what my list's possibilities include:  the new Cursive, Texas is the Reason, Miracle of 86, Nada Surf, OK Go, Mock Orange, White Stripes, and old Sugar Ray.  I'm a sucker for those groovin' sounds of Sugar Ray, so sue me. (except their new cd is mung).  Other than that, I'll probably do some Bowflex tomorrow sometime, and the rest of the week consists of getting a haircut, cleaning my room, playing some basketball, and making a mix tape.  Yeah, that's right, a mix  tape .  I don't have a cd burner like all of you technologically advanced folks.  It also sucks because if I make a mix tape, I don't have a tape player in my car.  Oh the headache!  In other news, my car is doing it's thing again.  The check engine light is randomly coming on and then disappearing again, and my thermostat gets really high, but doesn't go into the red area, and thus does not overheat, but it seems too high to me.  The last 2 times I've brought it to the mechanic, they've said, ""I don't see anything wrong with it.""  Now if I had a light that said something like ""check heartbeat,"" I don't think my doctor would be like ""well, I looked but I don't  see  anything wrong.  Those guys should examine my car if they're going to have it all day and find  something !  Make it up at least.  I won't know.  Anyway, let's see if I feel like taking it in again tomorrow."	m
"Walking through the park with you wednsday was really nice, how we were leaning towards and nudging into each other. It's funny, but that's one of the 3 times I remember us holding hands in public.  I guess I'm still not sure what you mean when you say you're still ""figuring us out."" You've been saying this as long as we've been together, and I wonder when, if ever, your emotions will resolve. I would hope that after spending a few years together you'd have more conviction about your feelings.  Funny how it seems like as time passes we get closer in a lot of ways, but on some level we get further apart. Is that because we want essentially different things from each other? Or is that because of fear? I'm not sure what you want or wanted from me, but when I'm feeling down I imagine that all you ever wanted was the promise of good sex on a regular basis.  What I want and have always wanted from you has been more that that. I want the promise of the potential for deep love and the possibility of a committed relationship. Of course, I never expected any of this from you right from the start. But I did expect your good intentions and an investment of time and emotion to figure out what we could have together.  I know this is the wrong thing to say, but I really need to know that you love me. If you truly don't know what you feel, then I need to get out of this now. I need to move on and find myself again , I need to live.  Cotton Candy Wishes, Me"	f
"I really want to order a bag this week but I keep seeing more and more I like, although I wish I could see them in person to feel the fabric and see how heavy they are. My old bag is twice as heavy as my computer.    These bags are from  urlLink Cased Closed Bags , a company owned by April Lockhart and Debra Wong, who longed to have stylish laptop cases that were affordable. Cased Closed comes in ten styles, from the casual Messenger style  Larry Jr . to the more business-like  Neal Collection . The Bob style is my favorite because they're compact enough to function as sleeves for a larger bag, and you can get cool linings like gingham or  urlLink sushi .   I am now coveting the  urlLink Levenger Laptop PJs . These cute pastel colored leather bags never have to come off since they have a ""trap door"" that gives you access to all your ports. There's also an adjustable band for added protection, so your computer gets a snug custom fit. Sounds just about perfect and the price isn't too bad either at $119. We may have a winner.

"Every Sunday I serve my time in God's army aboard a luxury aircraft carrier. We move slow and we are rarely anywhere close enough to shore to actually see any of the people we are out to liberate. We fly sorties such as Operation Short Term Missions, Operation School Curriculum, or Operation Beth Moore Conference. Most of us don't fly in these important missions, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying the prosperous life of a soldier. Our ship has plenty of activities - putting greens, a sports ministry, restaurants, and even a special 'fright house"" on Halloween! We don't get a lot of visitors from the outside - but thats the benefit of being on a mega-sized luxury aircraft carrier - there's enough people around to pack it in without noticing the lack of outsiders (besides - you can't let just anybody on a luxury aircraft carrier - there's a war on!).

There isn't a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes. My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom. He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.	f

Then there's Lucy Liu's character in Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle.  White dad?  WTF?  Oh yeah, of course!  Cuz we all know Asian guys don't exist.  Fuck these morons who put that idea together.  They really need to learn to accept all of us, not just the women.  And lastly (and least recently) there's the Fast and the Furious movies.  How can you have an import car racing movie without Asians?  There's just no excuse.  Morons.  Keep in touch with issues of the blood on www.angryasianman.org."	m

Why User Interface Design is Essential for The Ultimate User Xprerience ?      Hmm!!! If muy Blog was not UI Friendly would u have come and visited it again, no right !.      In todays complex world of Software One must put themselves in the shoes of the users and think, Why this has to be like this and why not like that?      Therefore, one must make sure that UI is the prime concern of any S/W Development Process.      One cannot assume the User knows !!!, but dont develop software thats too easy to handle as well ;).      We have to follow the guidelines given to us by our Team Architects and Leaders etc .       And we must meet with the customer from time to time and discuss other issues involving the UI Design Phase.      Next we all can sit comfortable coding and going thru the QA Cycle etc.      What do you think?      Send me a mail to      urlLink  anil_mahadev007@hotmail.com       on the above matter.

hmm... read this quote today:  Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you  may look back and realize they were the big  things.   then i recall such a literature text from sec 2... Sing to the Dawn... there was this thing that Dawan said about small changes lead to big changes like ripples in water... and yes so do the little things! they have the power to change so many other things and cus a great difference.    Enjoy Simple Pleasures   is one of the traits of me as quoted from the personality test from ccal camp. i believe i not only enjoy simple pleasures, i notice simple things in life too! how many people will actually how the trees by the roadside seem to show a mood jus by the way they bend and sway in the wind? how many people take time to look at the cat curled up by the lift and wonder how blissful that is? how many people look at the rats running across their paths and wonder where they are going to, instead of cursing them for scaring everyone?   these little things, little nature things in this artificial world, its them that make my day. i cant face a computer a whole day, but i can sit on the beach looking at the sea forever. its such a noisy world today that we no longer notice the quiet happenings around us... these quiet happenings that let us wait and ponder, stop to think about anything and everything. we mus realli slow down our footsteps...  hmm in the midst of wondering why im still online now... haha...   pondering... -Chee	m

"Past, present, future From Lissa-Love's 'Present Living' post....    #{TIGGR} - Well, again i disclaim my own work here...this is not my doing: thanks to Luke over at ?Luke Says Moo!? for this addition to a previous topic hosted here...here is an alteraative view on ?Present Living?       I thought I'd give a little follow up because she keeps harassing me about it...and because it is something to think about on occasion.  Anyway, I classifymyself as someone who lives in the present. I don't dwell on the past or the future. I learn from my experiences and relish history when I have a chance to take it in. I plan for the future in some ways, but I don't plan for what my life will really be like.  Normally I move with the flow and do what needs to be done as the tide of the day brings changes with each ebb and flow. I know that I have little to no control over the actions of those around me and throughout the world, so I do my best to work with what I'm presented and go on from there.   Which brings me to thoughts on permanence. Lissa suggests that people living in the past and future deem that ""for anything to have meaning, to be important, it must have longevity and be 'permanent'."" Which seems like a good conclusion considering the present gives very little permanence to anything.   ""The only thing that stays the same is everything changes."" (Tracy Lawrence, ""Time Marches On"")  To me there is no permanence in this corporeal world because nothing can stay the same. Throughout human history, recorded or otherwise, everything has changed. Languages, cultures, war, kings, lands exchange owners, and even the Earth changes shape given enough time. Even the heavens mark the change in the passing of time. Stars burn out, new stars are formed, comets zip by, and space itself continues to change with each passing moment.  For that matter, neither the Earth nor the heavens mark any life except perhaps the very, very few that become part of ancient myths and modern histories. Even then, what we pervceive as permanent will eventually be washed away, like a sand castle on the beach, because time will wear away all meaning and the future generations will be left to wonder and speculate just as we do with the Aztecs, Mayans, Egytians, Greeks, Romans, the Aryan peoples, various African peoples I don't even know the names of, and I'm sure you get the point by now. Given enough time nothing that you or I understand as being permanent will be permanent.  Perhaps my concept of the future is too broad and those that live in the past and future only live in a narrow band of the past and future...perhaps just defining their present to be a few hundred years before and after their lifetime.   Anyway, I do believe there are permanent things in the world, but I can not empirically prove it's existence. I believe that the Creator has existed for all time and will continue to exist long after this world has been erased from the drawing board. I have faith that when I die my soul (spirit) will continue to live on as a unique individual like I am now and that I will spend the rest of eternity in bliss.  Perhaps it is my belief in the spiritual that frees me from the need of permanence in this world...then again I could just be screwed up in the head. You decide.  Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.  - Eckhart Tolle"	m

I'm the kind of person that craves a certain personal continuity. For me, personal authenticity is integral to maintaining stable and honest relationships. This is a virtue that I often encourage and look for in others. However, I have found that I am a hipocrate in my own quest to fulfill this challenge.  In some ways, I am a double agent. And metaphorically speaking, I guess this is just another mask I wear. I've been told that I have been doing this for years. However, I feel that I've just been saving people fromthe trouble of dealing with reality.   I know who I am, and I have a vision of who I might become. There is not one societal or familial bi-law that will prevent me from impacting the world around me. Nor is there any clause in any constitution that will hinder me from being who I really am. My humanity will always remain, depsite the hinderances of engaging in daily life. And I guess each person will view me in a different light. And in the end, does it really matter...for everyone has a different view of a good life. And I will always be transparent if you need me to be...	f

"Just re-read my Fahrenheit 9/11 interview and realised that I was a bit cruel - I forgot to mention any good points about the film. Since I've ranted enough about it I'll just list a few here rather then give a second (positive) review:  - Brilliant choice of Music (really highlights humour) - Some excellent editing which gets across some good points / laughs (The cut from Prince Bandar describing Bin Ladin to ... I won't spoil it for you is hilarious) - The ""success"" of the war in Afghanistan is really put into perspective. Great fodder against those who think of him as the war president. - Some very emotional scenes, most obviously the mother of the soldier who died in Iraq (although at the point where she broke down crying felt a tad voyeuristic for me) - Despite the fact that I was familiar with most of the news footage, the clips were very well chosen to give those who do not spend a lot of time going through the news a different perspective then what is often reported.  There can't say fairer then that."	f
"HE'S NOT JESUS CHRIST BUT HE'S GOT THE SAME INITIALS   I've been really busy these past few days, save for the last night where I just sat in a daze in front of the TV for about 4 hours watching episode after episode of season 3 of ""The Family Guy"" with the  urlLink new   urlLink roommates  (we try to take a night off from boozing and slutting it up every once in a while to recharge... i'm joking of course, sort of). It was an exhausting weekend.  Before I go into talking about my weekend... about the photo: ""A man was fined nearly 300 dollars for drunk driving a donkey cart in a small South African town and then telling police he was unconcerned 'because the animals knew the way home.'(AFP/POOL/File) "" What an ass!  Last week I mentioned something about my parent's house being haunted. I've got no doubt in my mind that it is. After dinner on friday night I went to use the powder room for things that one does there -- and the light turned off when i was in a very compromising position. Thinking that the lights went off in the rest of the house as well, I grabbed a magazine to cover my junk from the world and ran to the door. It was stuck and i couldnt get it open. I panicked and yelled for my mom like the little bitch i am. I got it opened and to my disbelief, the rest of the house had light. Everything had light, but the bathroom i was in. I touched the light switch and it turned right back on. This ghost hasn't been around the whole time, and if it has, it hasn't been really interested in hanging out with us. But lately it's been racing across the room while my mom is on the phone, making my blind dog bark at the air, and has one hell of a sense of humor, shutting my lights off as I sit on the can. My aunt thinks it's a friendly ghost. You can buy shit from my parents' ghostly  urlLink garage sale  this weekend.  Saturday I went out with my mom, aunt, and my cousins who are about 11 and 16. My little cousins are so fucking awesome... i'm stoked to be related to them. My cousin Renee is a gorgeous little girl who looks like a supermodel mixed with an Olsen Twin. She's 11 and short for her age, but stylish as hell. She was wearing this pin striped pair of pants, black chuck taylors, a layered top, and a blazer. I was like ""Whoa, you look like you're in the Strokes!"" her older brother, Eric (16), said ""yeah, that's the look she's going for.""   We went to H and then I took Eric to Search  Destroy -- which he totally dug, but didnt get anything, and then we went to Urban Outfitters (dont front like you dont go there too... I know you do).   The Streets' ""Fit But You Know It"" is totally fucking Blur's ""Parklife."" How fucking fun!   Anyway, Saturday night I made my way to  urlLink Misshapes  hear  urlLink Audrey  DJ amazingly, and to dance with Lizzy,  urlLink Niki ,  urlLink Marc , and  urlLink Greg  Check out  urlLink Me and the Boyfriends .   urlLink Andy  found himself cornered by me so I could ask him details about the logistics of beheading a person. This sent Greg packing and made me thirsty for more knowledge. The best thing about having a friend like Andy, other then him being awesome, is that he's got this vast knowledge about science and medicine and can explain things to me in the most laymen of terms. He's like the indie rock Stephen Hawkins for retards like myself who like to ... uh... lay-men.  It's weird. A few months ago I would get quickly exhausted from partying. I found myself crawling back home at midnight the latest to find my bed and fall asleep. I guess with the weather being better I'm able to find myself crawling home at after 4am these days... which I did on saturday night with Andy,  urlLink Brian , and a few of their friends. We didn't go home as much as we went to the new club on Delancey called The Delancey. We tried to get in cause we heard there was an open bar, and found ourselves out of luck with a doorman wearing ill-advised leather pants. I never saw this dude's face cause he was like, 39 feet tall. So Andy and his lady friends walked me home as the sun was rising.  Sunday night I went to the  urlLink Trash  party so i could DJ for the party kids. I really love DJing... it's like the most fun a person could have sometimes. I think I got really drunk tho, cause I remember straight lines were a joke, and I remember having a conversation with someone and having to keep my eyes closed (which hopefully made me look a bit pensive) so they wouldn't cross and give me a headache. I've been to Don Hills twice in the past month for the first time in ages, and both times, there were dancing half-naked people. Oy Vey. My parent's at least could breathe a sigh of relief that I wasn't one of those dancing-half-naked people. Not that there's anything wrong with it...   When I was sober during the night I got to see Jess' new band called Americana and was fully impressed. There's something there for sure. A mix of Smiths and a bit of Emo... it was right up my alley. Jess has the looks and charm that a frontman needs and I'm gonna keep a steady eye on these guys.  Monday it started pouring outside. I had invited some friends over a few days earlier promising a  BBQ with lots of yummy food, but suddenly it didn't look like it was gonna happen. So me and the girls decided to cut our losses, tell people not to come over when they called to see if it was still on, and stick all the food in our fridge save for a few beers and some food that we were gonna cook up for ourselves. Needless to say, everyone figured that rain couldn't hold 3A down and showed up. We found an indoor grill and cooked up almost all the food we bought. Sorry to anyone i told to not come. We're gonna have a .. um.. rain date. I manned the grill, by the way, and made some killer chicken.  Yesterday morning my brain was fucked. I had spent the past three days partying and was really super tired. I found myself in Long Island interviewing a former member of a boyband who shall remain nameless (there's a clue to his itentity in the title of this blog posting) in his hotel room, and then later in his bus. The Singer (who will be called TS from here on out) and I got off on the wrong foot, arguing about race car drivers. He told me that some drivers could make up to $200 Million A YEAR. Yeah, you read that number right. So my thought was ""I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck."" This statement launched TS into a total ghetto accent that was so over the top, it was a parody of itself:  Me: ""I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck."" TS: ""When it's what you know, you do it.""  Me: ""Well, fine, but it seems unnecessary to keep it up if you're bringing home a check like that. All you need is one check and you're set for life."" TS: ""They're just doing what they know. They can't help it. It's what they know."" Me: ""Well, they should get to know something else. Something less life-threatening."" TS: (getting a bit hostile) ""What's they supposed to do? Be an accountant?"" Me: (getting annoyed) ""No, that's the point! They don't need a job. They can chill out. Hang out with their family. Go traveling."" TS: ""Not when racing is all you know. You gonna tell a pilot to get a different job when all they know is flying?"" Me: ""If I knew a pilot who brought home a $200 Million paycheck for one year of work, yes, I would tell him that.""  TS: ""Well, it's all they know.""  According to the former member of a popular boyband that is possibly no longer together but features a member who went out with a popstar who is now looking like she had too many days snorting oxycontin, race car drivers aren't very faceted."	f

"I feel bad for this guy. This is why America's tightening up on security, y'all should too...   JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African radio reporter went a little more live than anticipated on Tuesday when he was mugged on air for his cellphone.  Regan Thaw of the Johannesburg area Talk Radio 702 was about to deliver an on-site report from a local squatter settlement when one of the locals pulled a gun on him.   ""I asked him a question but got no response, I just heard shuffling and muffled voices in the background,"" said 702 news editor Katy Katopodis, who was on air with Thaw at the time.  ""He had a gun held to his head and he was told 'give me your phone' ... (the man) threatened to kill Regan if he didn't hand over the phone and his belongings.""  Thaw complied and the show went on -- without his report.  The on-air mugging was rare even for South Africa, which has one of the highest crime rates in the world. But Katopodis said it was not altogether unprecedented.  ""The exact same thing has happened to me five years ago. I was held up at gunpoint while doing an interview,"" she said.   That'd be quite embarassing. I won't go as far as to ask what race this mugger might be..."	m

urlLink Amritas  has it down pat when he says that  barn  is cognate to the word  bear  (as in to bear a child). The word  trú , however, is cognate to the words  traust  and  tryggð , meaning  trust  and  loyalty  respectively. They in turn are cognate to old germanic, celtic and slavic words meaning strong, healthy, active etc. Examples are the ancient prussian  druwis  (loyalty), welsh  drut, drud  (strong), ancient slavic  su-dravu  (healthy) and the sanscrit  daruná  (hard, strict).   So the modern Icelandic word trú (religion) originally meant to be loyal to your god. Not necessarily to have faith in him/her.  The old word for religion -  siður  - meant, and still means, tradition, behaviour, morality.  Siðaður maður  means a well behaved, well brought up, moral man.	m
"I woke up around 9 and ate some breakfast that Lance made. Jason and I played some Soul Caliber 2 and tried to rip each other off in baseball trades, with no success. Lance left around 11 to do something at his mom's house and it suddenly dawned upon me that Soul Caliber 2 was due today at noon and Lance was not around to take me to Blockbuster. Luckily, Jason can drive, so we took the game back and while I was there I bought Halo for only $29.99! I had vowed that if I repeated my winning ways at poker night on Monday that I would buy Halo and I did... so I did.      Anyway, we got home and then Jason decided to take off for his house. Then I did some yard work with Lance, such as cutting down trees and packing up the lumber. Sortly after Lee called and we decided to hang out at my house. After Lance and I dropped off some gas at his mom's house, we picked him up.      Now, I know this may be quite embaressing, but Lee brought over some Magic cards he owned from eons ago and we proceded to play quite a few games. I pretty muched owned him, with the exception of of like 3 games because I couldn't get any mana.      Anyways, after that we played the co-op missions on Halo until around 11:30, beating two missions on Heroic in the process. Then my mom came home and Lee called his mom to get a ride home.      After Lee left, my mom went totally crazy on me because Lee was here too long and I wasn't spending any time with Lance, who she said had to sit in his bedroom all day because Lee was here. First of all, when he is not working, that's all Lance does anyway! He sits in the room on the bed watching TV. In fact, as I write this at 1:30 on Sunday I am going to get up and wager that that is what he is doing right now, this very second. Yep, I just went in there and that is what he is doing. Anyway, I argued that point and some others to my mom and I guess me making sense or proving her wrong is not allowed so she got all pissed about that. Then Lance came out of the bedroom (!!!) and heard what we were talking about and decided to get all rough and tough and ""give me a talking to"" in which I was ironically not allowed to talk. He said ""Tyler gets this, and Tyler gets that.... blah blah blah blah... and Tyler doesn't care whose toes he steps on when he does things."" Now, I wasn't allowed to talk, but keep in mind that every single time Lee or Jason has come over, or if I've wanted to go somewhere, I've asked permission and every time he has said yes. If he ever had a problem with it he could have said no, so I don't see how I am being selfish if I am asking permission, and while I know I have had lots to do with friends recently, it's spring break, it's the only time I'm going to be able to do that sort of thing until summer.      Anyways, I was sent to bed without being able to talk at around midnight so I didn't have access to the computer to write my blog, which is why I am writing it Sunday after church. Being midnight, and being spring break, I was none what so ever tired, and even if I was, I was in a bad mood so I wouldn't be able to sleep. I instead proceded to clean my room to the fullest it has ever been. I actually pulled out all the crap in my closet, including the ancient toy box with really old toys, and bagged up stuffed animals for Goodwill, vacuumed the floor, and put everything back in a nice new order. The room I got from pulling out the toy box I used to house some Beanie Babies from under my bed which we can't just give away, and some of my shoes, which I really have too many of. I then had lots of new room under my bed but didn't have anything to put under there so I just organized it a bit and left it how it was. This all took me quite some time, and I wasn't completely finished, but I was tired, had church to wake up for church at 9:15, and I had more or less forgotten about my bad mood so I went to sleep at about 2:30."	m

There is a chance I will end up in Michigan, as there are three Michigan projects - but I don't think my CM's will rank them very high.  There is one in Missoula, MT which I think they may want.  It involves a lot of camping.  Actaully, many of the projects involve the environment - that means killing things and deciding what has a right to live in a certain place at a certain time; because it's obvious that just the ability to grow does not merit the right to do so wherever one pleases.  And here you might say that I sound just a bit cynical.  And, you would be right.     The truth is that I am becomming increasingly dissolusioned with the work that I am doing.  With the exception of the Boys and Girls Club, I havn't really felt that the work itself completed here was necessarily....uh....pressing.  But hopefully we will get a good project next round (which begins September 15th).  That's all for now...."	f
Just writing to explain the title. Once I figure out how to do it, three of my friend will join the blog.  I promise they are more interesting then I am.	m
When I got home this evening I was prepared to write about Mayor Bloomberg's trip to Israel (point of that?);  men's junk and how much room they have to make for it in the subway (you know that guy who has to spread his legs so far open to make room for his fantastically large genitalia that there is no room for a human woman's hips to fit into the space next to him), and my high school prom.  But  I'm in a good mood and I don't feel like whining.  Don't worry.  I'll get back to it.  The Bloomberg thing has me a little peeved.  Thank goodness he doesn't draw a salary as a mayor and thank goodness he flew on his private jet because I would've been majorly pissed if we were paying for this trip.  When did he become a diplomat.  I'm sure if all Jewish folk could go to Israel to express their sympathies that we wouldn't unless we all had family there.  Perhaps he does have family there and that's why he went.  Yeah...Okay....I can live with it if I convince myself he has family there otherwise it just doesn't make much sense.    This afternoon, I hung out with a good friend of mine.  i rode the bus with her across town so she could pick up her child from summer camp.  Next to me, on the bus was an average sized guy sitting with his legs as far apart as humanly possible, squishing me and my woman sized hips into my friend.  I took a good look at him and could see no conceivable reason for this as his junk(or what I could of it through his pants anyway) seemed to be of normal size and distribution.  I really think that some guys have an overexaggerated notion of the packages they are carrying.  Needless to pointout that this does indeed ANNOY me.  My HS prom date was 2 inches shorter than me.  He was a nice guy but we were kind of the last two people without dates (yeah, sad, isn't it?) and we decided to go together, DUTCH.  My HS prom song was DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME. (it wasn't a good song then either).  So, after paying for everything myself with a combination of my newspaper route, grocery store cashier, Baskin-Robbins counter person, money, I was surprised to learn weeks later that my date actually liked me in a romantic way.  Sadly, I had to let him know that I did not return his feelings, which made me feel like crap, because there's never a nice way to reject somebody.  I was also a little annoyed that he let me pay for everything since he liked me so much, so I guess it was a little bit of an FU too on some level.    The nice surprise of my prom was that he was a really good slow dancer.  It turns out his mom was a dance instructor and he had been dancing for years and he made me look really good on the dance floor.  The other great thing was staying out all night with my parent's permission.  The next morning they surprised me by throwing a brunch before we all went on our after-the-prom GREAT ADVENTURE excursion.  I was somehow tricked into go onto ROLLING THUNDER.   All the way up the first incline I kept asking is this the coaster with the big drop and my friends kept saying no, until the big drop.  I screamed the whole way and couldn't talk or breathe normally for about 10 minutes after walking away from the coaster.  I haven't been on another one since.  Otherwise, it was fine day spent with friends.  Whew!!  I managed to get it all out anyway.	f

i don't post much but i read that Nan thought she might be the oldest in here - nada - i  graduated in '70. that makes me 50 and i still have a hard time with it.  i didn't mind turning 30 or 40.  i was living in san diego in my 30's and 40's and loved it.  i just recently moved back to minnesota to be closer to my family.  i miss sunny, warm southern caliornia and i miss being 40!  i just can't find anything too great about being 50... uggh??  but i love this blog even tho i don't post much.  i get a kick out of what you all get talking about while we wait for a rick sighting.  and oh yes, as long as i revealed my age, i might as admit that i'm a democrat - which can make watching fox news annoying at times.  but i like the challenge plus it's about time as cnn and msnbc definitely sway to the left, it's good to have a strong conservative view to listen to.   and they are fair.  enough of that... i forget who likes todd conners [ at 50 my memory started going ? ] but i saw him today and what a cutie and he was dressed casual again, no tie.  i miss seeing rick all roughed up... you kow what i mean... and i miss his hat.  we have a thunder storm going on here, lot's of lightning. i love a rainy night. that's a song isn't it?  =) sorry i don' post to each of you all seperately... for the love of me i don't know how you all remember what you all said to be able to reply like you do.  be that as it is, my memory is shot.  but i am glad that melissa started this blog and you all can be sooo friendly.  let's hope rick doesn't take too long of a vacation this summer.	f

"Truck hauling bees crashes in Montana  Dumps honey, sending bees on rampage  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 Posted: 11:08 AM EDT (1508 GMT)   BOZEMAN, Montana (AP) -- A tractor-trailer overturned on a curve on a highway, spilling its load of hundreds of bee hives and unleashing some nine million angry honey bees.As in real estate, the key to this bee spill was location, location, locations as the crash occured just a few hundred yards away from ""the Bozeman openair center for young, slow childrem with extreme bee sting alergies"".

Anyway, I'm really thrilled to be  urlLink The Adventures of Pete and Pete . I mean, what other show gives the 11-year old main character a tattoo of a foxy lady named Petunia and has guest cameos by people like Iggy Pop? Some of the bands featured on the show are pretty cool too: The Apples in Stereo, Lucious Jackson and Magnetic Fields to name a few.  So what are you?

yikes - blogger's really updated since last i looked. image uploads, bullet points, margin adjustments, blockquotes. hell, i can even write in wingdings if i want.  see? now why the hell would i want to do that?      i've got my 3-month performance evaluation coming up on monday. we'll see how that goes. i should be set, but i really didn't get fully trained. i've been making cracks about getting fired, but maybe that's not such a good idea, in retrospect. on the other hand, maybe i shouldn't worry too much, given that they're doing my 3-month performance appraisal after i've only been there for two.   i'm losing weight. don't know why. friday, i had 6 bagels, 2 doughnuts, a cinnamon roll, strudel, captain crunch, and a variety of other foods while at work. and i can't even list all the stuff i proceeded to eat when i got home. and yet somehow, my belt is buckling one notch further in and i'm down to 170 pounds. i can't figure this out.	m
"Well, still no call from the software co. Still in limbo. I guess I'll be the aggressive go-getter mba type that I pretend to be and give 'em a jingle manana. I thought I wrote some kick-ass thank you letters too. I'm surprised to hear I haven't made the second cut. They probably think there is no way they can pay me as much as they think I should earn since I have an MBA (a real MBA from a full-time program, from a TOP 20 in the USA PROGRAM, I might add...), but they are wrong. The current place of rabota pales in terms of salary and bennies.      But that's neither here nor there. I love that phrase. Much better than saying some dumbass analogy or even a non-analogy and then adding ""if you will"" at the end and trying to sound smart. I noticed that this was quite the catch phrase for tv journalists covering Bush's Iraq War Part Deux. It drove me bonkers to hear that phrase everyday. ""It's carpet bombing, if you will."" Well, it either is or isn't. What if I WON'T? It was major pet peeve of mine. It seems to be disappearing in the vernacular lately, slava bogu (thank god, for you non ruso or uki speakers).      Went to  urlLink Kalachandji's  today for lunch with the boss immediately over me. It was pretty good, but it always kinda tastes the same. Not that I mind, but I couldn't eat that everyday. The soup was some kind of dahl and was pretty extraordinary though. This one hari krishna chick there is intriguing, not in a lesbian way or anything, please! She has been there since I started going there about 3-4 years ago. She is really thin, is white, always wears a sari, and has striking blue eyes. I heard her speaking with some guy there once in a language I knew was Slavic, but couldn't figure out what it was. I asked her and it turns out she's from Serbia. I found that so crazy. She always acts kinda stressed out and harried, so maybe this hari krishna thing isn't really the inner peace she was hoping for. But maybe she doesn't like wasting time waitressing. I'd rather be chanting. She must have come here some time ago. So once upon a time hari krishnas were dancing down the old cobblestoned and shellshocked streets of Belgrade in the early 1990s getting converts? OK, I'll dump this Orthodox/Catholic/Muslim thing, just get me the f outta Dodge, dude!"	f
"Heya! HaHa. Yeah. Yesterday no blog. More details to follow.  Okay. Yesterday I went to Physics Make-up. Only little people attended. Meow moo! Okay. After that was meowful. Hmm. I wanted to buy Beyonce's CD ""Dangerously In Love"", but the shops ain't open so early. Just then, Wendy smsed, asking for company. I happily agreed!  I joined her at Sata at Civics Center. I thought she was sick or something, going to see the doctor. It turned out that she has to go for a medical check-up for Poly. Hmm. There were lotsa Poly students. Her queue number was 214. wah lao! We waited for approximately 45 minutes for that freaky number to show up. Hmm. I was listening to the radio on Wendy's handphone while waiting for her. Wah lao! It took until 1+ for the whole checkup to end. 3 hours! HaHa! Can die man! Never mind la. Her brother came looking for us, because he has to apply for some CPF thingy to pay for Wendy's poly fees.  After settling the CPF thingy, me and Wendy went to eat. We ate at Yoshinoya. How meowful! Okay. After eating, we went back to Civics for Wendy to take a passport-sized photo. We went to Tom first, and Wendy brought a pair of shorts. O.O After picture taking, we went back to Causeway Point. She photocopied her brother's birth cert, and we finally went to buy my Beyonce's CD! YaY! What a wonderful CD! Really good songs in there!   We then went back. I did my Chem homework. Wah! A lot man. Besides Redox, I did Mole Concept's 2 tutorials. It took me till 7+ to finish. Even ducks are meowing!   Hmm. Okay. The main reason why I didn't blog yesterday was that I was hooked up reading ""Something More"", a Harry/Draco slash. A really good Harry Potter fan fic! In total from Friday's and yesterday's, I spent more than 5 hours reading the 34 chapters. I do hope the next chapter would come up soon. It's such a captivating story. Oh god...the whole while I was reading it, powerful emotions evoked from me. The constant 'butterly-fluttering-in-my-stomach"" effect whilst reading the story....the courtship, the love..kept me on constant edge. Oh man! It was great! Fantabulous! I will post a paragraph below, which I feel is the whole point of this story. I like this para very much also. Oh yes. A sentence too.  ""As they both rushed towards their release, an overwhelming sense of connectedness flowed through them. All that existed was the exquisite feeling of being buried inside of someone, of being filled, of skin on skin, of heated kisses. All these sensations blended together and Draco realised with a jolt that he couldn’t tell where his feelings ended and Harry’s began. Draco suddenly became aware of the power flowing around them; a fine golden haze swirling around them; a pure and simple connection on the deepest level possible.""  ""Their lips met in a tender kiss. It spoke of desire and need, but most of all, it spoke of love and in the end, words weren’t needed.""  Oh okay. So sue me if I had picked out the sex scenes. Sheesh. They do really describe the whole essence of this wonderful story. After all, this is a Harry/Draco slash. What is a slash if you don't have an essence to it? Okay. I am waiting with bated breath for the next chapter!  Okay. Today I mainly watched TV and did my GP homework. HaHa. I finally watched my Moulin Rouge VCD. Today, in the Unbeatables, XiaoTong was raped. Now, I've seen that scene (duhz) and I felt appalled. Now, I still continued to feel shocked. Imagine the pain she went through...it's horrible to think of! Being robbed of her virginity...that's very devastating. Gone, just like that. All because of a guy's lust. Really stupid things rapists do. Try getting raped and see how you feel, you idiot rapists out there! XiaoXing is horrible!   Okay. Here I am. Online. HaHa. Oh well. There's gonna be a gas law quiz tomorrow! Must study later. See ya then. TaTa. Night blog!"	m
Ecstasy equates To the morning dew Reminders to all  We are washed anew Life and memories The past holds the clue Learn now  Convert In the morning dew. Birds sing freely Souls that dance in the night Clearly blessed  Ready to take flight Wishes and dreams Soar towards the sky All within reach Life so fresh Blessed in the morning dew Slowly I rise From the tumbling sleep Gentle waves of moisture Gracing my feet The path is in front The road is behind Baptized each morning Drenched in holy morning dew Each day is a gift  Cherish and laugh Tomorrow is too far Today is the plan Live in the moment Walk in the air  Roll in the grass Let it dance in your hair Seconds of youth Vibrate and sing Flooding the soul Ecstatic tears  The Goddess brings Disguised and hidden Do you not see? Here is the key Breathe in and deep Refresh the life within An instant, forever Be the morning dew. Birth of the morning As the foliage is feed Colors and songs Waltz through my head I hear the whispers Feel the calling Forever I live Kissed by the morning dew. dlt © june 26 2004	f

"If the first story wasn't garbage enough, here's more for you   Great, now Ashcroft's involved.  apparently Toronto garbage is a  urlLink terrorist threat .  Or at least a threat to American Homeland Security.    Michigan legislators drafted a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking them to investigate the process by which garbage is imported across the boarder.  They cite recent ""drug"" and ""medical waste"" shipments that were hidden in Canadian garbage trucks.  Once again, we are coming to a crisis point with our garbage.  2 of the top 3 candidates insist that we can divert our waste to the point where virtually no landfill space will be required.  Neither of those two candidates indicate how long it will take to ramp up their diversion efforts so we can begin a ""phase out of garbage to Michigan"".

Next SPACE Launch  So this SPACE kids come through again.  We went and scoped out the next Launch....  I'll talk more about it when it gets closer.  Very cool though.  Going to do something unconventional to celebrate Valentines Day.  Think a party that's totally out of the box.  Yeah. We also talked about these two statements: 1 - The church of God has a mission in the world. 2 - The God of mission has a church in the world. Which one is right and why? It made for some good discussion, especially after we framed them and talked about the previous four launches and which ones were relevant to statement #1 or #2. Just for the record, #2 is really the right one.  Debate among yourselves in the comments...	m
"Opinion:   urlLink When women bring home the bacon, why is it such a problem for the man to just accept it?  Even now I run into problems people have with that.  I've dated two people and it truly ruined everything because they were insecure that I had more money than them. It makes no sense to me why a woman is put down when she is successful! I don't even have an actual job yet, so what's the deal? You should be happy for your partner that they are doing well and support them in whatever they do, regardless if it makes money or not. It's always okay if your a struggling artist, but a female successful artist will have trouble finding a man because of their stupid insecurities. If you let money ruin your love you will never find actual happiness. And I have found the best quote from  urlLink South Park :  ""Love isn't a decision. It's a feeling. If we could choose who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.""  -Mr. Twig   urlLink How to Travel Like a Billionare  I found this article to be very cool! A day after I found  urlLink Sky Jet . I would love to travel like this and would probably be the only way I will get on a plane in the near future aside from going to a hypnotise.   Personal:  Recently I have been having the best time! Cirque du Soeil was excellent! I love the  urlLink Aerial Act , they were so hot!!! I also found the restaurant we ate at ( urlLink Da Ciro ! Everything that day was just great, except for the horrible cuts on my foot my great looking sandals made. But damn I looked good! We even have  urlLink pictures !  I also went  urlLink hiking  with Ross yesterday. We had a picnic by the water fall and got lost, but it was just such a nice day and so beautiful there we didn't much care. When we got back Ross bought me  urlLink Gerbera Daisies , my second favorite flower! It is actually equal to Roses, it depends on the season and these were just to nice to pass up! Such vibrant colors they just scream happy!  Soon we will be going to OBX (Outter Banks, NC).  My Uncle Rob has a count down on  urlLink his site ! From today it is 58 Days!!! Everyone is on a diet to look great on that beach, but we will still be that pale white family you see. Can't change genetics... but who cares I will be in OBX and you won't!  The poll is still out  urlLink Would You Date Me?  I have added a few answers to it so that it's funnier to me! So cast your vote!  Well back to the usual now that I am done babysitting. Looking forward to July 4th, that firework festival of explosions! Not looking forward to summer classes and summer work. But I get super student next semester! Yay me. I think it has something to do with the fact I am the only person who has worked there over a semester! But who cares! YAY ME!!! I get tuition paid with it and well I also did excellent last semester grade wise, 2 A's and 3 B's. Although I think one of those B's should be an A I did great considering the jerks off professors I had for most of the semester. Hope this new thing won't kill me or my grades. My problem with this job is I care to much about the computer problems there for personalizing them and driving myself crazy with things I can't fix. But I still like it and you can not beat the 5 minute commute.   My Job is:  Student computer aids are available during their work hours to help students and faculty with basic computer needs. In addition, they will be monitoring computer labs and learning about software and hardware.  Computer aids are Macintosh friendly, have a good attitude, and are comfortable assisting faculty. Basic video, audio, and troubleshooting will be learned and used to help students and faculty. -Work extra hours (up to 20) -Handle extra responsibilities -Know MORE technically about all of the labs we support -Be a ÂleaderÂ among lab assistants -Supervise overall facilities as far as locking down, closing out, etc. when necessary -Be available to other student aides and instructors for help with troubleshooting"	f

BTW, lunch was fab! We discussed  Other Girl  at length. She sounds normal (which will  not  stop me from being violently jealous but at least  DB  may not get completely jerked around by this one.) He says she's got a potty mouth too, which is scary when you think about it. Two attractive young things (one skater, one emo) slouching around the town, swearing like sailors. Their children will be a  delight !     I was going to practice pool tonight but my teacher  Buddy P  hurt his back and can't come so I may just wuss out. Hurting one's back has got to be the suckiest type of physical ailment that can happen to one. Or if not  the  suckiest, at least a close second. I'm sorry you're hurt, Dude. Wish I could help. Since I cannot, I will instead, go home and watch bad TV while I eat noodles and think fat thoughts. Alone. On the couch. Missing my kid. Sigh. k. Just needed to take that moment. I'm fine now.	f
This is mine: I'm the year of the DOG:Someone may try telling you cock-and-bull stories so as to influence and exploit you. Don't be too credulous, especially if someone asks you for a helping hand or for a loan. At work, delays and annoyances will get on your nerves; nevertheless, try to control yourself. Differences of opinion with one of your best friends. Perhaps it'd time to go to your dentist's for a cleaning.	m
"Happy Father's Day, especially to my Dad! I had a fun chat with him on the phone today. That's always good. I'm looking forward to seeing my parents in 3 weeks. I'll be spending an entire week with them. That will be the first time I've done that since I got married 7 years ago!  Church was awesome this morning and the pastor did a great talk on the heart of a man. He pointed out that the father is the main identity shaper in a child's life. For boys the father needs to answer the question ""Do I have what it takes?"" And for girls he needs to answer the question ""Am I lovely?"" Pastor then ran down a laundry list of things that a father needs to be. He topped it off with, ""And if you had a dad who was all those things AND he is a follower of Christ, you need to be calling him and thanking him today, because you are in the minority."" As we pulled out of the parking lot Ked and I discussed, as we have many times before, how thankful we are for our dads. Not only are they everything on that laundry list, they both also have a strong faith in Christ which they passed down to us. Ked and I often discuss how thankful we are that we carried very little baggage into our marriage. That definitely gave us a solid foundation to build our marriage on. It also gives us the confidence that some day we will be totally awesome parents as well. So thanks, Dad!!"	f

The haze has come, AGAIN. It seems to come every year now. Hang Indonesia for the open burning. Don't I have a right to breathe clean, fresh air in my own country? The pollution here is bad enough without the tronking(cool word i picked up from Kass) haze. It messes around with my eyes, which are the most sensitive part of me. It was already bad enough with the chemistry experiment with sodiun thiosulphate and the smell, now the haze decides to come along too! Those people who do open-space burning are VERY insensitive, methinks. Actually I wanted to go play tennis today, but thanks to the haze, I think I'll just stay indoors.  My parents are coming up this weekend to visit me(woohoo?). It's been some time since I've last seen them. My mum has chilled out and is not scolding me now, thank God. I don't know how much more of that I can take without really exploding... I've never really exploded at my parents before, it at all. I'm getting a chair from my house(the chair at the hostel is very uncomfortable and hurts my back) and some junk food. Hopefully they'll bring up a guitar too, so I get to learn to play at least one musical instrument properly, not like memorising songs as I did on the piano.  That's all I've got for now. I'll post if I have anything more to rant or rave about, or just for the fun of posting (is it really that fun?).	m
"Hey everyone, quick updates on whats going on: - Congrats on the new house, Sayas boys.  It's fan-frickin-tastic.  BYOT on the Halo parties.  Good luck getting on to that roof, Russ.   - What the Hell happened to The Moffats? - Workouts have been going okay.  I'm crazy hurting from the leg workout, though. - Moving across the hall in three weeks... still wondering if I should even pack shit up, or just carry it over - EVERY Bomber road game is televised!!  And 7 of 9 home games!! - Where's Rusty, Mikey, Nelly, Glenny, and Yoyo Ma? - Everyone here gone to movie-vault.com already?  Have you told friends about it?  I'm hoping for a very, very, very small cult following, but I'll settle for monstrous commercial success that allows me to completely sell out. - Someone aped ""Walking Tall"" so I won't be reviewing that one... but watch out for reviews on Street Fighter, Fubar, and Tommy Boy. - Now that Wes is back online, and Yo knows about this place, and Shaner's thinking of shit for the Scrabble Project, and football seasons coming up for Nex, this place should get busier than a Giant Tiger with wild colored, short-sleeved, button-up comic book shirts on sale for 12.99."	m
"This was emailed to me and I couldn't resist putting it here.       This is one of the most interesting things I have heard in a while. Hope you think so too.  For all the scientists out there, and for all the students who have a hard time convincing these people regarding the truth of the Bible, here's something that shows God's awesome creation, and that He is still in control.    Did you know that the space program is busy proving that what has been called ""myth"" in the Bible is true?  Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore, Maryland, and a consultant in the space program, relates the following development.    I think one of the most amazing things that God has done for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at GreenBelt, Maryland. They were checking out where the positions of the sun, moon, and planets would be 100 years and 1,000 years from now. We have to know this so we won't send up a satellite and have it bump into something later on in its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite and where the planets will be so the whole thing will not bog down.    They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries, and it came to a halt. The computer stopped and put up a red signal, which meant that there was something wrong with either the information fed into it or with the results as compared to the standards. They called in the service department to check it out, and they said, “What's wrong?"" Well, they found there is a day missing in space in lapsed time. They scratched their heads and tore their hair. There was no answer.    Finally a Christian man on the team said, 'You know, one time I was in Sunday School, and they talked about the sun standing still.' While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an answer either, so they said, 'Show us.' He got a Bible and went to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with 'common sense.' There they found the Lord saying to Joshua, 'Fear them not,  I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before  thee.' Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy, and if darkness fell, they would overpower them. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That's right... 'The sun stood still and the moon stayed and lasted not to go down about a whole day!' (Joshua 10:12-13) The astronauts and scientists said, 'There is the missing day!'    They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not  close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day was 23 hours and 20 minutes ... not a whole day. They read the Bible, and there it was  'about (approximately) a day.' These little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble because if you cannot account for 40 minutes, you'll still be in trouble 1,000 years from now. Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits.    As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but they got out the ""Book"" and read these words in 2 Kings that told of the following story: Hezekiah, on his death bed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof.  Isaiah said 'Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?' Hezekiah said, 'It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees. Isaiah spoke to the Lord, and the Lord brought the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD!  Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!     Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!"" Isn't it amazing?     References: Joshua 10:8 and 12,13 and 2 Kings 20:9-11."	f
The past 2 nights in our apartment have been interesting, to say the least. A new gal has moved in upstairs and let me tell you, we are in crazy land! Since I officially start working next week (thank god) I am kickin it at home and around town this week. This gal upstairs is apparently home all day but hardly makes a peep. We can hear people walking around-- virutally every step, so it is more than obvious when someone is in the apartment upstairs. So, this person makes virutally no noise all day long, but at night-- the freaks come out! Starting around 11 (usually when Matt and I go to bed) she and some other person (we guess to be a guy) are apparently moving large pieces of furniture across the floors and dropping them right above our heads. So, I've hooked it up with the earplugs and have been sleeping ok, only to wake up for the extra loud noises. It's par for the course when you live in an apartment. But, the real treat was last night. We thought the guy that used to live upstairs was loud- apparently he was not getting laid! At the start of the very loud 12:30am s-e-x (bed squeaking like you wouldn't believe) Matt and I flicked on the light and uttered the profanity of our choice, only to find that the roll in the hay only lasted for about 2 minutes! Tee hee. At least we can count that kind of noise to be minimal!	f
~   Back again am I.  ~          My trip was fun; don't ask about it because I don't want to tell you. Nothing personal, I just don't want to talk about it.     Guess what part of me grows to  four times  the normal size when excited.        I thought  urlLink this  was kinda funny. I don't know which one I'm picking this fall.     I like the lightning bolts.   ~        So there's people I know I'm gonna miss, and those that I won't know I'm going to miss. While at Fernando's house today, I was looking through the most recentyearbook and saw a lot of people I'd already forgotten about, but will miss. Not that I've  forgotten  them, I'd just forgotten about them. Stupid college, it's scattering the few friendships I actually have.     There's not really much I want to say right now. I just don't really have any material, I'm sorry. Oh, and now look: I only have three more posts left.        Eff this ess. People are stupid... Nobody really specific that I can think of right now, it's just a general observation I've come to realize and appreciate over the past 24 minus 7 years of my life.     The answer is my pupils.

"ok.. i know i said i was back.. but then i didn't write anything for like 10 days... we've been reeally busy. like this week we've been at hubbard painting, patching, wallpapering, and more painting.. it sucked. but at least we got to go to adventureland.. that was fun. it was hilarious too. my second cousin who's like 4 was at a magician show at adventureland and the guy did a trick, and she yelled out ""is that all you got?"" it was soo funny. but yeah i went on like everything.. except the spinning things.. my stomach can't handle those. but the main reason i couldn't get on my blog here is that my mom's comp wouldn't let me access my own website.. it was completely stupid. so i had to wait for my room to get hooked up with internet.. and when i finally did, i couldn't get on because we were always unpacking.. it drove me crazy. i could only get on at night for a little while.. and i didn't have time to type. but yeah, this time i think i'm back for sure... maybe.. i think... well anyway, we got to go to jordan creek mall in des moines! it was cool... but i hated their hot topic. it didn't have any of the shirts that i wanted to buy. they just had like metallica and slipknot and metal crap.. and that sucked.. but i got a cool shirt at pacsun. so that made my day. but i was thinking about kait the whole time that i was in hubbard and des moines.. literally. like i would space off and just think about how much i love her... i missed her incredibly. but then i got to stop in humbolt on the way back to hartley last nite and we got to spend what.. and hour together? i don't know... but it was fun.. we went on a walk and played basketball and sat by her fire pit.. i wish i could just stay for like a week in humbolt with my grandma some time and kait and i could hang out and do fun stuff... but now school is too close... 10 days.. urgh.. but yeah i am going to get to see her on labor day i hope.. so thats good. but i thik i beter go.. i'll type later. peace =) kait-""i love you"" is the truest thing i could ever say to you... jon"	m
"Ash-Sharq al-Awsat, a London-based Arabic paper, yesterday began the complete serialization of Saddam Hussein's final novel written as a free man, Be Gone Demons! (اخرج منها ياملعون) As though it were just any book, the newspaper posted a picture of the cover and of the author (appearing as a jailbird, however, not as absolute ruler).  The Associated Press's Salah Nasrawi helpfully provides a summary of the plot, as related to him by Ali Abdel Amir, an Iraqi writer and critic who read the whole manuscript: The novel recounts a Zionist-Christian conspiracy against Arabs and Muslims that an Arab army eventually defeats by invading the Zionist-Christian land and toppling one of its monumental towers, an apparent reference to Sept. 11, 2001.  The novel opens with a narrator, who bears a resemblance to the Jewish, Christian and Muslim patriarch Abraham, telling cousins Ezekiel, Youssef and Mahmoud that Satan lives in the ruins of a Babylon destroyed by the Persians and the Jews. …  Ezekiel, symbolizing the Jews, is portrayed as greedy, ambitious and destructive. ""Even if you seize all the property of others, you will suffer all your life,"" the narrator tells him. Youssef, who symbolizes the Christians, is portrayed as generous and tolerant - at least in the early passages. Mahmoud, symbolizing Muslims, emerges as the conqueror at the end of the book.  The critics have not been kind to Be Gone Demons! Saddam ""was completely out of touch with actual reality, and novel writing gave him the chance to live in delusions,"" comments Abdel Amir. Saad Hadi, a journalist who had a hand in the production of Saddam's novels, agrees: ""He lost touch with reality. He thought he was a god who could do anything, including writing novels.""  According to Hadi, Saddam's favorite novelist was Ernest Hemingway, in particular The Old Man and the Sea, whose style he tried to emulate. ""He'd sit in his state room and recount simple tales, while his aides recorded his words."" Youssef al-Qaeed, an Egyptian novelist, describes the dictator's oeuvre as ""naïve and superficial.""  This is hardly Saddam's first published novel. ""At the end of the year 2000, a publishing sensation left Baghdad abuzz with rumor,"" reports Ofra Bengio in ""Saddam Husayn's Novel of Fear,"" an analysis of Saddam's becoming the author of a historical romance titled Zabiba and the King. Although Bengio finds the novel ""boring and incoherent,"" she argues it ""is best understood as Saddam's own preparation for his final descent from the stage. It should be read as a summary of his life, an ‘artistic' contribution to his people, an epitaph, and a last will and testament, all rolled into one.""  One might have thought that more pressing issues of state would have been on the absolute dictator's mind by late 2002, as the Bush administration made clear its impatience with Iraqi behavior and signaled an intent to take action. One would be wrong, at least according to an account given by NBC news on July 15, 2003: Tom Brokaw reported on the authority of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, already in captivity, that ""in the last year Saddam Hussein has been preoccupied with writing three epic novels.""  Even more remarkable is the information from a subsequent report in London's Daily Telegraph: ""Saddam Hussein spent the final weeks before the war [in March 2003] writing a novel predicting that he would lead an underground resistance movement to victory over the Americans, rather than planning the defence of his regime. As the war began and Saddam went into hiding, 40,000 copies of Be Gone Demons! were rolling off the presses.""  After Zabiba and the King, Saddam produced The Fortified Castle and Men and the City and finally Be Gone Demons! Tariq Aziz's comment suggests that another two novels were in the works when war so rudely interrupted.  Saddam's being caught up with novel writing as war was brewing directly confirms a thesis I presented months back, in ""[Saddam's] WMD Lies,"" to explain the seemingly missing weapons of mass destruction. Supposing there really are no nukes in Iraq, Saddam gave off the impression he had them as a result of a terrible error.  This mistake can best be explained as the result of Saddam inhabiting the uniquely self-indulgent circumstance of the totalitarian autocrat, with its two key qualities: Hubris: The absolute ruler can do anything he wants, so he thinks himself unbounded in his power. Ignorance: The all-wise ruler brooks no contradiction, so his aides, fearing for their lives, tell him only what he wants to hear. Both these incapacities worsen with time and the tyrant becomes increasingly removed from reality. His whims, eccentricities and fantasies dominate state policy. The result is a pattern of monumental mistakes.  Saddam Hussein's being consumed with a literary urge, even as his dictatorship was about to be destroyed by the greatest power on earth, points to both his hubris and his ignorance. It also goes far to explain how he could think there were nuclear weapons in the works when they did not exist by the time his political demise began in March 2003.  --Sounds just like Judy Collins only with jihad, hate and most importantly killing Jews. Can't have an official Saddam book without killing some Zionists. Rot in hell asshole. I hope Satan has his way with you for eternity.  Andrew B."	m

First things first!   A great big, huge, enthusiastic  CONGRATULATIONS  goes out to AnnaLisa, who finished her bar exam earlier this week. I got an e-mail from her today saying she has mixed feelings about her actual performance, and is hoping for the best / preparing for the worst. To celebrate the fact that it's over, she's going to rest up in DC a bit and then head to Fargo to visit her parents for a couple of weeks.  And next, tomorrow is my three-month GP checkup. While this isn't quite the same grounds for celebration, I'm rather anxious to check in with the doctor and make sure I'm still pointed in the right direction. I'll also be donating blood for the purposes of getting cholesterol, CRP, etc., checked. Here's hoping I don't pass out or leave the office in sobs. If I do -- either -- and even if I don't, though, I'll be sure to make up for it by doing something fun Friday night. ;)	f
Main Girl? Founder na lang tawag mo. Wala akong pera last week. Di makabili ng prepaid. Obvious ba? Naku naman kayo, oo! Kung kailan ba naman ako wala, anraming pi-nost! Maybe I should disappear more often to get this thing going. Corn is good but I prefer rice.	m
I used to think that in all those conry love movies I watched in my past, that words were love  When someone said they love you that it was all in the words  A girl would melt to her knees all because of the words that were said  In this journey of life I've learned that in some cases talk is cheap  Then again I said some, for the most part its the combination of both words and actions  The feeling you put behind the words you speak, how much of yourself you put into it  When you love someone, tell them, and mean it  This is just something I was thinking about, however it works for you, go for it  later	m
Mmmmmmmk.  Let me clear my throat.  I think I’m having an allergic reaction to all these pine nuts I’ve been eating…they’re some unsalted, un fried mother fuckers that kinda explode on the way down.  I’m on a health food kick lately, thinking about going macrobiotic again.  It also has to do with the fact that I’m having that swallowing thing again—where the taste of meat makes me gag.  UPDATE:  ronald reagan is dead.  The war mongering leader of the  other  dark ages, the one we thought was so bad until this one came along.  R.I.P., homey, if you can, considering you go to your grave with the blood of millions on your hands, all of the early victims of AIDS in the U.S., who might not have gotten infected had you released the facts about the disease when they first became apparent.  You could have done something—called a state of emergency, gone on all tv stations at once and broadcast the information into every single home everywhere.  But no, it was only a bunch of faggots and druggies and low lives who were dying, so you sat on the information.  You dyed hair, actor cowboy smiling mother fucker.    I spit on yr grave.  Anyway, this post is mainly a response to  urlLink my colleague down below.   Werd,  urlLink Wallpaper Blake —you know that I’ve got mad respect for you, but I’m gonna have to take the mic and breakitdown.  Straight off you talked about the futility of  urlLink my pissin with the christians .  OK, yeah I’ll be the first to admit it’s most likely going to be a struggle that ends in vain.  These folks believe one thing, and I believe another, fine, fine.  But I resist the notion that “you’ll be prayed for and sacrificed for something you really don’t undersand”.  Because I understand, believe me I do.  You see I had my own time on the mountain, with something I thought was Jesus Christ.  Maybe it even was Jesus Christ, who knows.  There were several of us from town.  We drove around in a van and everything.  It was all kinds of fucked up, especially towards the end.  And it took someone who was like I am now—someone from the other side who  understood  to pull me the fuck out so that I’m the well adjusted person you have before you today.  Ha, yeah.  I know these born again kids so well because for two years I was one.  There you have it—the shocking truth about me.  All that and a bag of chips.  I can get in the minds of these people. For instance, I don’t think that guy had a heart attack while watching The Ashton of the Christ out of  fear .  Nah.  His heart prolly burst out of pleasure—extreme, total body pleasure at watching his near naked god being brutally murdered on a huge screen in dolby digital surround sound.  (can I get extra butter on these, pleasssse?).    See the whole problem with fanaticism is that these folks AREN’T scared.  As far as they can, they've stripped themselves of that basic human reaction. Maybe from the perspective of someone like yourself who’s apparently interested in spirituality and is perhaps even quite knowledgeable about several religious texts, having a fierce and devoted attachment to a very SPECIFIC and EXCLUSIONARY way of thinking might seem like it’s cool or interesting, but let me tell you, the church I was in was completely off the chain.  The sanity chain, that is.  We were ready to give our lives, yo.  I’m being completely real with you.  And there was no sadness, no quivering—only joy and loud, out-of-tune singing.  I was so happy, it was ridiculous.  I’m talking about the very beginning, which as I said before took place on a mountain.  In the winter.  With the ice and snow, just as it is described by Nietzsche.  It was not unlike the beginning of an acid trip—I felt myself floating above my body, and when I touched myself I seemed to be burning.  BTW, speaking of terrorists, you asked what was the common thread that allowed me to “lump together” Al Queada, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the PLO.  Terrorism.  Each one of these groups has openly admitted to engaging and/or promoting terrorist activities that have taken the lives on innocent civilians.  Each one of these groups has SWORN not to stop these activities until the dissolution of the state of Israel as well as a host of other demands—but Israel is the big issue.  As well as any one who aids the Zionist cause, i.e., the United States.  So you see, they do consider us their enemy—these groups have declared jihad upon us.  That’s not just like declaring, oh, we don’t like you.  No, jihad equals a holy war.  A fight to the death.  Some, “you have fucked up my honor and now I have to avenge myself” fer real shit.  You point out that it's only me and some crazy dude in bellevue who can even fathom the mere possibility of some one taking over the U.S.  Wow.  There’s some REAL patriotism fer ya!  You can’t even imagine that someone could whup our mighty ass!      (yeah...one of the things I go on about with my loony bin friend is about how at one point, our enemies get the idea to fly our own planes into skyscrapers.  The Twin Towers.  Yep.  And then you know what happens?—they fall down and everyone in them dies and our coward ass president is MIA and no one is at the wheel and we're getting all sorts of conflicting reports, standing in midtown staring up at the chrysler building wondering what's next...)  sounds pretty crazy, huh?  I think our time, as in the American time, is coming to an end.  The great pendulum of history is slowly swinging back out, heading for asia...but that's another post...  At the moment, they hate us if for no other reason than because we’re friends with Israel—a friendship that is based, NOT on the fact that Israel is largely Jewish, as is the anti-Semitic train of thought, but because Israel is the only democracy in that region.  Yep.  Think about that for a second.  The only democracy.  I mean, democracy is a funny thing.  When it’s really working you don’t think about it.  But the other middle eastern countries don’t have any real democracy—at best they have see-thru, flimsy displays of it.  These countries are run by dictators and monarchs acting like dictators, or, as in the case of Saudi Arabia, an extremely wealthy theocracy that rules over a population that is very poor and completely without rights or freedoms.    Do you know what they do to you if they think you’re queer in Saudi Arabia?  Secret religious police roam the streets, following people and listening in on conversations.  An outspoken woman such as myself would not be allowed to exist there. Women are treated like straight-up property in some of these countries, even in the “friendly” ones, like Jordan and Kuwait.  They can’t vote, they can’t go to school, they can’t leave.  Even in Egypt, a relatively western and modern country, a woman has to get her husband or father to grant her written permission if she wants to leave the country.  It is considered a CRIME if she is caught alone in a house with a man who is not her husband or family member.    Tell me, why is this OK?  Oh, because it is a different culture than ours and we need to respect that.  Yeah?  Well then why was it OK to be against apartheid in South Africa?  Apartheid is a social system developed by the colonizers of South Africa, the Dutch—its’ been around forever, it’s a part of South African culture.  So why is being against apartheid considered the right and normal thing to do, but being against queers getting stoned isn’t?  If being liberal means that I’m supposed to tolerate that which would destroy me, than I’m not a liberal for that reason alone.    Speaking of violence—what “facts” do you have about the “systematic eradication” of Palestinians?  Because if you’re talking genocide, than you mean mass killing at a mechanized rate (but not necessarily mechanized, as was proven in Rwanda and in other African countries this very second.)  If by this hyperbole you meant to suggest the horror of the Palestinian situation, than I can only agree with you.  When I was in Israel a few months ago, I hung out in several cafes where Arab and Jewish Israelis chilled together with no problems.  It was Passover but everyone had big baskets of bread on their tables.  Not so much of the country is particularly religious. Again, it’s the fanatics, on both sides, who refuse to relent on this conflict.  Meanwhile their children are out smoking joints with one another, listening to hip-hop and dreaming of escaping to India and forgoing their mandatory, four-year army duty.    The way I see it, the former terrorist leader Arafat has been the biggest roadblock to peace in this whole thing.  The man is concerned with one thing and one thing only—holding on to his power by any means necessary, a feat made all the more ridiculous and harmful in its effects after the Israelis surrounded his compound and consigned him to it.  Why doesn’t he say, OK, enough already!  Someone else lead the show—do what’s best for the people!  Nope.  The prime ministers who have tried to come up and get something done resigned under pressure from him and his PLO goons.  You see, doing what’s best for the Palestinian people isn’t really an viable option in Arafat land.  Why doesn’t he give up all the names of the terrorist leaders that everyone knows he knows to the UN instead of turning a blind eye to every bus that gets blown to smithereens?  Why didn’t he sign the Camp David peace plan a couple years back, instead of backing out in the 11th hour, demanding that a Palestinian right of return be a part of it.  He had EVERYTHING else.  Everything.  Half of Jerusalem, the West Bank, and most importantly their own internationally recognized country.  There was going to be peace but he said no because he wanted the right for every single Palestinian citizen (of Palestine) to be able to pick up and move whenever they wanted into Israel and live their with full rights like every other citizen.  Isn’t that wild?  You’re getting your own country but you need to have the right to move to someone else’s whenever you feel like it.  Israel isn’t that big, yo.  But it’s got infrastructure and industry, so there’s reason to believe that should the Palestinians get right of return, the country would be overrun.  That said, it is imperative that Israel pull out of its territories.  Sharon needs to tell the fanatics from Brooklyn who ship off to the holy land with “go forth and multiply” ringing in their ears that the dream is over. Time to wakey, wakey and give the land back and end this nightmare.  You hear about he Golan Heights and the West Bank, places that Israel took over after the war in 67.  This occupation is a reference point, a touchstone for  those who feel Zionism has gone awry.  While there’s something to be said for that, what you don’t hear about very often is the situation of that war.  I think a lot of Americans don’t know the story.  How several countries decided to attack Israel at once.  How they put it in their constitutions that they would “push the Israelis into the sea”.  How they waited to attack on Yom Kippur, a holy day of fasting, when they knew the Israelis would be weaker for having not having eaten…  The chips were stacked against Israel.  By all accounts that shit should have been over.  They consider it a miracle that they survived, and the settlers who live in the lands that they won from that conflict (it’s the ultimate underdog story, not only did they win but they beat their collective ass too) point to this miracle as justification that they belong there, that the land has been claimed in the name of a  self defending act.  (The names of some of these settlements are taken from the names of WWII ghetto resistance fighters.  There’s the mentality that “look, you’ve tried repeatedly to erase me, kick me the fuck out of everywhere I try to live and blame me for everything under the sun so now I’m not leaving.”)  But leave they must, IMO.      That’s the only way out of a fucked up situation—compromise, not everyone gets what they want.  Incidentally, which country in the world gives Palestinians the most aid?  The U.S.  Everyone goes on about the U.S. giving money to Israel, but the U.S. gives money to a lot of countries, and for every million they give to Israel they try to match it up on the Palestinian side, the idea being that the situation will get worse if there’s a radical disparity in who has what over there.  Israel’s not a rich country.  I saw out of work, poor folks and a lot of shit wasn’t exactly state-of-the-art.    Yeah, but at least they have homes and their own country to live in—you might say.  Fair enough.  The refugee situation is totally fucked up.  But why don’t people also wave their finger at Jordan, at who’s border millions of displaced Palestinians have been living for years?  Jordan refuses to let them in.  You have to understand that despite the fact that many are educated, cosmopolitan people, the Palestinians are on the bottom of the Arab ladder.  Everyone’s given them the finger at some point.  None of these powerful kings and oil sultans want to waste their hard earned capitalist dollar on helping them out, so they tell their uneducated masses that it’s the jews’ fault and maybe america’s fault too which gives all those dispossessed people something to vent their anger out, other than at their government…just like the germans did after WWI.  It’s crazy to me how it’s the same story, all over again.  Or I should say, again and again and again.  All through out their history, the Jewish people have been hunted down and persecuted, condemned, hated and blamed.    I’m not jewish, btw.    I’m just trying to step back and see the situation from all sides.  I still have the luxury to do that.  I get the paper delivered to my front door.  I’ve cried at pictures of dead Palestinian kids and I’ve cried at pictures of dead israeli children.  I don’t think either side is to blame.  Ultimately, it’s the specter of organized religion that presides over all this—with its long, grim reaper face like that mask in Scream.  Werd is bond, I’ve got a lot of luxury.  Most people in this world have nothing.  If they have one possession it’s the wooden bowl they hope they’ll be able to put a scrap of food in.  And here you and I are, chatting, among other things, about how we’ll need to get cars to get around the city, cuz the trains will be on lock down for the convention…    mental note:  don’t forget to put “no blood for oil” across the side of my hummer…   We are all guilty.  Every single one of us in front of our monitors with our iced latte swirl hair gel drugs subwoofer cellphone wall-to-wall organic put that in yr pipe…  Dunkin donuts, starbucks…taco hell, kmart, the payphone at the parking lot…  (with the broken glass and the gay piece of ass)  I don’t know if I want any of it to go on either.    In our next and perhaps  Final american incarnation, perhaps we can be a little more stripped down.  A little skinnier, a little less obnoxious.   urlLink Susan Sontag is right, we are those photographs.   And I totally agree with you about the rape shit, abner louima, etc.  But then you say “become human and touch the earth?” Whaddya mean?  Are you talkin to me in this bit?  Cuz lemme assure you that I’m human, alright.  Human, all too human.    You’re right of course, that I can do better.  Yep.  Yr totally right about that, sweetheart.  I’mtryini’mtryini’m tryini’m tryin  (we’re all kids, letting of steam in one form or another)   par example , this manifesto.  Anyway,  I’ll let you sleep now  I lay the mic on the table  Having slayed y’all  Like Cain slew Abel…  Peace, Blake  Peace, werld.	f

I'm not going to write a ton today, because I'm in an odd emotional place, and don't really want to explore.  TONIGHT IS SKYBLAST! the MOTHER of all fireworks displays. More on it tomorrow.  Playoffs start tonight in the DNL: Pubbers v. South Hills in round one. I'm still out, and probably more likely to be on the 15-day, than be listed as day-to-day.  The weekend's shaping up nicely: Skyblast tonight, Game2 and party at Sprout's tomorrow, probably my first Bucco game with Gavin on Sunday. Monday will be HUGE also: Game 3 (Pubbers try to clinch) and RAW IS WAR at Mellon with my DREAM MATCH main eventing. More info on  that  over the weekend. (stay tuned for my Jerry is God post).  well, kiddies, that's about it for now. Comments have slowed, so i've added a sitemeter to track how much traffic the Kingdom actually gets. I hope you're out there, cuz the fun's just starting.  until next time I remain, -apk	m

"So, in the last few years I started taking all of my CDs out of their respective ""jewel cases"" and putting them into an organizer that would hold150 cds or something like that. This weekend I bought my THIRD CD organizer--that's a lot of tunes, folks. I'm really keeping the music department at our local Super Target alive and kickin'! Of course, seeing that I like everything neat and organized, I have to keep all of the CDs in alphabetical order--this becomes problematic when adding a CD or two to the collection every two weeks or so. Zorro was a dutiful kitten and helped me re-organize this weekend though. (and by ""help"" I mean he sat smack-dab in the middle of the CDs, purring and rubbing his head on my knees trying to distract me from the task at hand.) One of my most recent music finds was Jen Chapin's album ""linger"". She's a wonderful singer/songwriter from NYCwho kind of has a folk/jazz feel. Her dad was Harry Chapin who sang ""cat's in the cradle""back in the day. I highly recommend that you check it out. I think you can listen to some of her songs on her website  urlLink www.jenchapin.com  Enjoy!"	f

This was caused by my mom hidin my yearbook somewhere and my sister havin my cell at her UCLA soccer camp. Oh well.... we see what happens. Anyway, my mom said somethin that kinda scared me the other day.... well actually, she asked it. She asked, ""Why aren't you more social?""... That one caught me by surprise. I didn't know how to answer, cuz I havent found an answer to that already. I have ideas why, but they probably just excuses. And it's weird, cuz I still don't really have an answer to that... But anyways, it's a constant boredom for me cuz I got no practices and no license. So I won't be postin again til somethin actually happens... which might be a while, lol.

"From Brand Autopsy:    Being visionary is a double-edged sword. Sometimes you can be so visionary that others can't relate, understand, or even care. The Segway Human Transporter is a great example. Everyone will agree that the Segway is inventive and visionary. But this visionary ""scooter"" is so visionary that people can't relate to it, understand it, or even care about it. On the other hand, a simple visionary device like the iPod is an invention people can relate to, understand, and care about.  Whole Foods Market was/is visionary in the natural/organic foods arena. For many years, people outside of the core wellness audience couldn't relate, understand, or care about Whole Foods vision of changing the way the world eats by selling only natural and organic goods. But that has changed as more and more people can relate to, understand, and care about living a more authentic, tastier, and healthier life.  Now, Whole Foods is about to embark on another VISIONARY goal ... Animal Compassionate standards that go WAY BEYOND their currently high standards for how they require farmers and ranchers to raise their pigs, cattle, chickens, etc for human consumption. Fast Company's profile of WFM in their July issue touched upon this visionary animal compassionate goal. The double-edge sword for WFM is ... this visionary goal will come at a cost to consumers. The beef, chicken, pork sold under these animal compassionate standards will be HIGHER in retail cost. Will customers relate, understand, and care enough about this visionary goal to pay a higher price for their protein?  Many times people are too comfortable with their own box to think outside of it. That is the double-edge sword of being visionary."	m
I wanted to be your good friend...but good friends don't hide things from each other, and good friends aren't in love with each other, and good friends don't miss someone so bad that your heart aches and you'd forsake anyone else just to know that one day they'd be yours again. Who am I talking about? It's hard to say. There is someone who seems to care about me a lot more than anyone else does right now, like, he cares about my opinion and he's genuinely interested in my trials and tribulations. But he's in California, of course. Then there's someone else, who cares off and on, who's still most likely in love with someone who gave him up so that she could be selfish and noncommittal, and there's a secret that I have that would put the hope back in his heart...and I want the hope to fade so far away that it dies. I am just so out of it. I'm sober, I had a sober day, but still...I'm pensive, melancholy...just not sure how to deal with the phantoms from my past altogether and these feelings like little windwhispers that don't ever ever let me be. The love of my life is a past tense sort of description, and the current tense finds him in love with someone else. I want to be his friend, I really do. I want to get over this...but do I really? Do I really want to get over this? I probably really don't, I probably just want things to work out for us. But he and I working out isn't probably what he wants. -sigh- I don't think I can type anymore without getting too worked up. Gonna stop now.	f

urlLink Hispanic Students and Community Colleges: A Critical Point for Intervention. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Victor B. Saenz.  From the ERIC Digest:  In recent years issues pertaining to Hispanics* in higher education have garnered heightened attention from researchers and policy makers, and as part of this attention, community colleges have begun to receive increased attention as the decisive link in the greater overall educational attainment of this group. Hispanic college student enrollments have increased steadily during the last two decades, driven by increases at two-year institutions that saw the number of Hispanic students triple (NCES, 2001, Table 207). Despite the surge in enrollment, this group remains notably underrepresented at all levels of higher education, and has one of the lowest overall educational attainment rates of any major ethnic or racial group (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Nonetheless, the community college sector has become a critical avenue towards higher degree attainment for Hispanic students as evidenced by the increasing number choosing this path (Wilds  Wilson, 1998; Fry, 2002).   This digest explores the status of Hispanic students at community colleges, including a summary of recent enrollment and transfer trends, a focus on factors that shape Hispanic student enrollment at community colleges, and an overview of an exemplary program that facilitates the successful matriculation of Hispanic college students from two-year institutions to baccalaureate completion.	m

Took the boat out for the second time yesterday.  It went fairly smooth.  It would have gone smoother if I hadn't smoked a little wacky weed.  My engine died on me while I was docking and I haven't tried cranking her back up.  This lifestyle is fraught with alot lof little headaches but it's all part of the experience.  But I had a couple of old friends over and we did some fishing.  I didn't catch anything.  ( I fish, but not very seriously.  I don't have the patience.)  But one of my buddies caught a 9 pound carp.  Last night I rode out on somebody elses boat.  That was a nice experience-going out at night.	m

"There's a girl in my Algebra 2 class who had a mental breakdown from boredom today.  I empathize with her like I do with little people (a.k.a. dwarves or midgets).  I mean, it's the same thing every single day.  I wake up stumbling and tired, go to school, and sit through every class.  I come home and sleep until dinner and stay up late doing homework, which makes me even more tired the next day.  The same exact thing every freaking day, except it gets worse as time passes.  Homework builds up, I get sleepier, the little sister gets more annoying, bed gets less comfortable...  I could go on and on.    So here's a seemingly unanswerable question: What cheers me up?  I have a list, don't worry. First of all, Frappuccinos.  They taste indescribable.  (Paradox!) Then there are those stores with the most amazing clothes. Playing jazz on piano. Playing Michelle Branch on guitar. Mexican food.  (Not just eating it, but the aroma and the presence of it is just wonderful.) The cute guys that turn my head when they pass me by. The cute guys that turn their heads when  I  pass them by. Compliments.  (The actual ones, excluding the ones about my clothes.) Friends and conversations with them. Nikka Costa, Thicke, Nine Inch Nails, and John Mayer. My pearly clips. The sight of [pretty] guitars. Alias, the show that airs on ABC at 8 pm on Sundays. And last of all, this song:  "" My Happiness ,"" by Powderfinger  I see your shadow on the street now I hear you push through the rusty gate Click of your heels on the concrete Waiting for a knock coming way too late It seems an age since I've seen you Countdown as the weeks trickle into days  So you come in and put your bags down I know there's something in the air How can I do this to you right now If you're over there when I need you here  My happiness is slowly creeping back Now you're at home If it ever starts sinking in It must be when you pack up and go  It seems an age since I've seen you Countdown as the weeks trickle into days I hope that time hasn't changed you All I really want is for you to stay  I know I know I know what is inside _______________________________________ I need a break from normality."	f

"We had a date last night. First we went to the korean supermarket in the Galleria shopping center, and took our time wandering through the aisles, tasting samples, and filling our cart to the brim. Standing in line for the checkout, my dad suggests that we eat dinner in koreatown before going home. ""Ok appa, what do you want to eat?"" ""I want to eat something that you might not like."" ""What is it?"" I ask, curious. ""G oat. ""  I am always up for anything new and exotic, so I agreed to try it out. We headed over to the restaurant, and whaddya know, they call it yum-so-boh-shin-tang, which literally means ""goat-dog-soup."" Now don't worry, they weren't serving dog soup in the middle of Los Angeles. This restaurant specialty substitutes goat meat for dog meat in the traditional boh-shin-tang.  The soup was pretty good. Spicy, lots of vegetables, and a very strong broth. Goat meat definitely has a distinct flavor. I asked appa which one he preferred, boh-shin-tang or goat meat boh-shin-tang. ""I've never tried boh-shin-tang, but I'm sure it tastes the same."" This was surprising; I myself have eaten boh-shin-tang in Korea. ""Appa, it doesn't taste the same at all. Dog is  much  better!""  I don't know, we just started laughing. The role reversal was kinda funny."	f
Well, I think Kacy and I are good now.  We were talking online last night and she was saying that some people pulled up in a Jeep, and pitched a tent in their front yard!  They had a clothesline, a fire, and everything!  She said that if they whipped out the guitar, that she was going to go live with someone else until they leave.  Apparently they're friends of her Dad's friends.  He doesn't even know them!  Damn hippies...  Ok, I want you to look at  urlLink this  and tell me if you see Atlantis there.  Apparently, I'm the only one who doesn't see it.  This is important, because if those stupid scientists managed to find Atlantis before me this means I'm gonna either have to wipe their memories and claim responsibility for the discovery or invent a time machine.  I don't think there's anything there.  All I see is little squiggly lines.  Stupid full-o-shit scientists.  Oh man, my quads hurt really bad today.  I even took care to stretch more yesterday, but I'm still sore.  Got go run early today because I have to go get my haircut and then we're going to visit my great-grandmother in the hospital.  She's supposedly gotten pneumonia.  I hope she pulls thru.  She's 93 and in incredibly good health for her age.  She only complains about not being able to see as well and her fingers don't function as well as they used to, which is a shame because she loves to crochet.  But she's a fighter.  She'll make it.  I'm gonna go.  Thinking of playing Indiana Jones on PS2 or drawing comics for a little bit.  But before I go, a shopping list!

RAJGHAT 2ND PUBLIC TALK 19TH NOVEMBER 1985   May we go on with what we were talking about yesterday morning? As we said, we are taking a long journey together, in a railway, a very long journey, right throughout the world, and that journey began two and a half million years ago. And, during that long interval of time, and distance, we've had a great many experiences. And those experiences are stored in our brain, conscious or deeply unconscious, deep layers of it. And, together, you and the speaker, are going to examine, explore. It's not the speaker alone talks, we're all talking together, only the speaker is putting it into words. And the words have a very significant meaning, not just vocabulary, but the depth of the word, the significance of the word, the meaning of the word. And, as we said yesterday, you and the speaker, are taking the journey together, you can't just go to sleep. You can't just say yes, I agree, or disagree. We went into that. We are not agreeing or disagreeing. We are merely looking out of the window, seeing what extraordinary things man has gone through, what experience, what pain, what sorrow, what unbearable things man has created for himself, and for the world. We are not taking sides, pro and con, please understand this very carefully. We are not taking any side, either left or right or centre. This is not a political meeting, this is not an entertainment, this is a serious gathering. If you want to be entertained, you should go to a cinema, or football, but this is a very serious meeting, as far as the speaker is concerned. He has talked all over the world, unfortunately or fortunately he may have created a reputation, and probably you are coming here because of that reputation, but that's no value at all. So please, together we are going to examine, sitting together in that train, taking an infinitely long journey. We are not trying to impress you. You understand? We are not trying to force you to look at something. We are looking at our daily life, and all the background of a million years, let's keep it to a million years, good enough, and one must listen to all the whispers, hear every movement, see everything as it is, not as you would wish it to be, actually what you see out of the window as the train goes by.  And, you have to keep awake to see everything that you're passing, hear every whisper, hear every sound, the beauty of the hills, the rivers, the stretch of water, and all the beauty around you. Shall we talk about beauty for a while? Would it interest you? Yes - don't say yes, yes, it's a very serious subject, like everything in life. So please, probably you've never asked what is beauty - not the beauty of a boy.  So to listen, not only to our own inward thoughts, feelings, and our opinions and judgments, but also to hear the sound of what other people are saying, not your gurus, that's all rather childish, but what other people are saying, what your wife is saying, what your neighbour is saying, to listen to the sound of that crow, to feel the beauty of the world, the beauty of nature. So, we're going to, for the moment, to enquire into what is beauty. Right? Because you are passing in that train the most wonderful scenery, the hills, the rivers, the great snowclapped mountains, deep valleys, not only things outside of you, but also the inward structure, the nature of your own being, what you think, what you feel, what your desires are. One has to listen to all this, not just say yes, right, wrong, this is what I think, what I shouldn't think. Or just merely follow some tradition, either modern tradition, with the psychology, physicists, doctors, computer experts, and so on, but also to listen, very quietly, without any reaction, to see the beauty of a tree. So we're going together to talk about beauty.  What is beauty? Have you been to museums? In the old middle-ages, or Renaissance, of the great painters, have you seen them, some of you? Probably not. I won't take you around the museum, I'm not a guide. But instead of looking at pictures, paintings, and the statues of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and the moderns, we are looking, asking, enquiring, demanding to find out, what is beauty? Not the form, not a woman or a man, or a small child that's extraordinarily beautiful, all children are. So, what is beauty? I'm asking the question sir, please answer to yourself first, or you've never thought about it. Not the beauty of a face, but the beauty of a green lawn, of a flower, of the great mountains, with the snow covering them, and the deep valleys, and the still tranquil waters of a river. All that is outside of you. And you say how beautiful that is. What does that word beauty mean? Because it is very important to find that out because we have so little beauty in our daily life. If you go through Benares you know all about it. The filthy streets, the dust, the lorries. And you ask yourself, seeing all this, not the mere tenderness of a leaf, or the tender generosity of human beings, but to enquire very deeply, this word that is used by poets, painters, sculptors, and you are asking yourself now, what is this quality of beauty? Do you want me to answer it, or will you answer it? Go on, sir.  Q: You answer it.  K: Why?  Q: Because we don't know.  K: The gentleman says, you answer it because we don't know. Why? Why don't you know? Why haven't we enquired into this enormous question? You have your own poets, from the ancient people until now. They write about it, they sing about it, they dance, and you say, I don't know what beauty is. What a strange people we are. But, if you ask who is your guru, who is your god, I believe there are 300,000 gods in India, pretty good, in Europe or America there is only one god. With you there are 300,000 more. You can choose any of them to amuse yourself.  So what is beauty? It's the same question sir, put into different words. What are you? What is the nature and the structure of you, apart from the biological factor. What are you? Pass some exams, get a degree, a job, become a physicist, a scientist, a treasurer for a government, what are you? That is very closely related to what is beauty. When you look at a mountain, snowcapped, deep valleys, blue deep hills, what do you feel, what's your real response to all that? Don't you know? Aren't you, for a second, or a few minutes, absolutely shocked by it? The greatness, the immensity, the blue valley, the extraordinary light, and the blue sky against the snowcapped mountains. What happens to you the moment you look at that - the grandeur, the majesty of the mountains, what do you feel? Do you for the moment, or for a few minutes, exist at all? You understand my question? Please don't agree, look at it very closely. At that moment when you look at something grand, immense, majestic, for a second you don't exist, right, you've forgotten your worries, and your wife, and your children, your job, all the messiness of one's life. At that moment you say you are stunned by it, which is, for that second, the grandeur has wiped away all your memory, for a second, then you come back. What happens during that second? Go on sir - what happens when you are not there? That is beauty. You understand? When you are not there. Don't agree sir. Don't shake your head, yes, yes. So, there, the grandeur, the majesty of a mountain, or a lake, or that river early in the morning, making a golden path, for a second you have forgotten everything. That is when the self is not, there is beauty. You understand what I am saying. When you are not, with all your problems and responsibilities, your traditions, and all that rubbish, not your family, then there is beauty. Right? When you are not there, like a child with a toy, as long as the toy is complex and he plays with it, the toy absorbs him, right, takes him over. The moment the toy is broken, he's back to whatever it was he was doing.  And we are like that. We are absorbed by the mountain, it's a toy for us for a second, or for a few minutes, and we go back to our world. And we are saying, without a toy, with nothing to absorb you, take you over, you understand what I'm saying - you know how a child behaves when you give him a toy? Or haven't you watched? The toy becomes to the child extraordinary, he's amused, and he plays with it. For a few minutes or a few hours or a few days the toy takes him over. Right? You understand my English? So the mountain has taken you over. Right? And, can you, without being absorbed by something great, be free of yourself? You understand my question? You don't understand this - you're too clever, that's what's the matter with all of you - too much learning. You're not simple enough - if you are very simple, not in clothes - deeply simple in yourself, you will discover something extraordinary. But you are covered over with a lot of knowledge, experience, and so on.  So let's move. We are going to talk over together many things. We've talked over beauty for a while, not the poet's beauty, not the poem, the literature, the essays, the beautiful novel, or the good thrillers. Probably you don't read thrillers - do you - oh, you are too holy! So let's look at ourselves. We have created the world. You, the speaker, his forefathers, past thousand years of generations and time. Right? So, what is all this about? You understand? You understand what I'm saying? What is all this noise about? Killing each other, maiming each other, dividing my god, your god. Why is this society so ugly, so brutal, so cruel? Yes sir, why? Who has created this monstrous world? I'm not being pessimistic or optimistic, but look at the world, the thing that's going on outside of you. Poor countries buying armaments. Right? Your country buying armaments, and immense poverty, competition. Right? Who has created all this? Will you say god has created it? He must be a messy god. So who has created this society? You are always talking about society. Who created it, who put it together? Lord you people! Haven't you put it together? Not you only, your fathers, your great grandfathers, the past generations of millions of years, they have created this society, through their avarice, envy. Right? Through their competition, they have divided the world: economically, socially, religiously. Right? Face the facts sir, for god's sake. You and the speaker, and his fathers, and fathers, back, back, back, and your fathers, as far as you can go, we have put this society together, we are responsible for it. Right, or do you deny this fact?  So we are responsible for this. Not gods, not some external factors, but we each one of us has created this society. You belong to this group and I belong to another group. You worship one god and I worship another god, you follow one guru, however silly and stupid they are, and I follow another. So we have divided society. Right? And we have divided not only socially, but also religiously. Right? Just look at it sir, for god's sake look at it. Geographically we have divided the world - Europe, America, Russia - we have divided the culture - Western culture and Eastern culture; we have made governments - labour, democratic, republican, communist. You understand sir, how our brain works - divides, divides, divides. Haven't you noticed this factor? And so, out of division comes conflict. Right? You have divided yourself as the good and the bad - I won't go into all that, it's too complex. For god's sake - you probably have never thought about any of these things.  So, we have created this society, so you are this society. You understand? You are the society. So, unless you change radically, you'll never change the society. Communists have tried this, forcing, compelling secretly, viciously, destroying millions, to force man, his psychology, his being, to submit to various forms of compulsion. You must know all of this. This is history - daily newspaper. And so where there is division, there must be conflict. Right? That's law. And we like conflict, apparently, so we live in perpetual conflict.  So we must go back and find out, what is the cause of this, all this. Is it desire, is it fear, is it pleasure, is this the avoidance of all pain, and therefore guilt? You understand all this, or am I going too fast? So let's begin to find out for ourselves what is desire. Right? That's the basis. Desire to have power, desire to achieve, desire to become somebody. Right? We are not against desire, we are not trying to suppress desire, or transcend desire, like the monks, like most of you, transcend, control, suppress, we're not going into that. We must, together, understand, what is desire. Right? What is desire? Are you working as hard as the speaker? Or you just say, well let's listen to that man, it's a nice day, a nice morning. So, we're asking, what is desire? How does it come about, what is it's source? Not how to suppress it, how to control it, or let it go, but the root of it. Aren't you interested in that? Aren't you interested to find out what is the root of it? Do you want me to explain? As usual. Sir, explanation is not the thing. Right? The word is not this - I may call it a microphone, and you will call it microphone, but the word is not that, therefore explanation is not that, the description is not that. When one describes a marvellous tree, the description is not the tree. So we are going to use words to convey to each other, but the words, the description, is not the fact. Right? So, at least one learns that. The word is not the thing. Right? My wife, the word wife, is not the wife. If we can understand that simple fact, you will treat her better.  So what is desire, and why does it dominate us? What is it's place, what is its nature? You understand? What is desire? You understand? All the monks all the world over, suppress desire, or wanting to transcend desire, or desire is identified with certain images, certain symbols, certain rituals. Right? You're all there some of you, the monks and all the rest of it. What is desire? Have you ever asked that question? Or do you yield to desire, whatever the consequences?  So we're going together, together, not wait for me, for the speaker to explain, but together we're going to look at it. Right? We live by sensation, don't we? There's a train going across the bridge: you hear it, you identify it. So we live by sensation - better food, better house, better wife. So sensation is life. Right? Part of life - sex is part of life, it's a sensation, pleasure. And we have a great many pleasures. Right? Pleasure of possession, and so on and so on. To us, sensation becomes extraordinarily important, part of life, right, part of our existence. If you have no sensation, you are dead. Right? All your nerves go, your brain withers, and so on. So we live by sensation. Right? Sensation being touch, feel, sensation; like putting a nail suddenly into your finger, that's sensation, pain you call it. When you see something ugly, how can you smile at it, that is part of sensation; tears, laughter, having humour, it's all part of sensation. Then what happens, we have this sensation. You see a beautiful house - which is it you want, more power, more money? The more; the more is part of sensation. Right? Right sirs? You're so hesitant, aren't you? So, what happens when you have a sensation? When you see something very beautiful, a car, a woman, a man, or a lovely house, what happens? You see the house, there is a sensation, then what takes place? Go slowly, you'll understand it. You see that lovely house, clean, with beautiful gardens, flowers, everything kept beautifully, that's sensation when you see it. Then what takes place? Sensation is natural. Right? It is inevitable, it is part of our life. Then I explain, you'll agree and say quite right, quite right, and go home, do the same thing.  So then, what takes place? You have seen that house, seen the garden, seen the beauty of the landscape, and how the house is built, with style, grace and sense of dignity, then thought comes along, makes an image of that sensation, and then says, I wish I had that house. You follow this - no, you don't. You see that house there - there is sensation. Just wait a minute, wait a minute before I go further. Sensation, then thought comes along and creates out of that sensation the desire to have that house. Right? Or something else. You see some politician riding in a big car, or cyclist ahead, and all the rest of that business, and you say, by Jove, I wish I had some power. That is, you have seen that, sensation, then thought comes and says, I wish I had that power. Right? At that moment desire is born. When sensation is given a shape, a form, then at that second desire is born. Do you understand what I have said? May I repeat it again, do you want it repeated?  Sir, you put a pin in my thumb, that's a sensation of pain. And, every record, every response is part of sensation. Right? Intellectual, theoretical, philosophical - sensation. We live by sensation. Be clear on that. We live by sensations, that is, senses responding, good taste, bad taste, it's bitter, it is sweet, and so on, we live by sensation. And when we see something which we have not got, like a house, like a car, like some, you know, that sensation becomes dominant when thought gives it an image. You understand? When thought comes along and says, I wish I had it. At that moment desire is born. Right? Don't look at me as if I am some crazy nut. You understand the subtlety of it? The depth of it. When thought gives a form, a structure, an image, to sensation, at that second desire is born.  Now the question is, can sensation not be caught by thought, which is also another sensation. You understand sir? Sensation, and give it time for thought to give it shape, that is an interval between sensation and thought giving it a contour. Right? Do it. See what is implied in it when you do it, not say yes, yes I agree with you.  Q: If you put a pin in my hand there is pain.  K: There is pain, then what thought does - no, wait sir, look at it, go slow, don't rush. I have pain in the thumb, in the finger, then, I want that pain to be stopped, so I go to a doctor or whatever I do. Right? Right sir? I want that pain stopped. Are we asleep? Yes. Sir, pain is another form of sensation. Right? Then thought says I must stop it. You don't say, let me look at that pain. Right? Haven't you done all this? If I'm ill, which I've sometimes been, I say, all right, wait until you feel - see what it means, what pain means, what pleasure means. Don't you do that, or is it immediately doctor? What? Immediately a doctor. My god.  Q: The whole response of pain - the pain and a doctor.  K: Yes sir, give an interval. You understand? Not say but I must go to a doctor, too quick. Give it an interval, a time, and you learn a lot from that.  So, I'm saying, when there is time in between sensation and thought, an interval, a long interval, or short interval, you'll understand the nature of desire. In that there is no suppression, no transcending. If you have a car, and when you drive it, not knowing the mechanism of it, the internal combustion of it, the machinery of it, you are always a little nervous that something might go wrong. Right? But if you know, if you have dismantled that car, as the speaker has done, totally dismantled it, don't get nervous, or something or other, when you dismantle it, and put it together very carefully, know all the parts, then you're master of the machinery, of that machine. Right? Then you're not afraid, you can put it together again. You understand? So, if you understand the nature of desire, the way desire begins, then you're not afraid of it, then you know what to do with it.  Q: You give yourself a pain...  K: I've explained sir. Sir let's move to something else.  There's something which you and I, the speaker, should talk over together. We have lived for thousands of years, and we have never understood the nature of fear. Right? What is the source of fear, what is the cause of fear. Right? We apparently have never ended fear, biological fear as well as, certainly much more, psychological fears, inward fears: fear of death, right, fear of not having, not possessing, not being, fear of loneliness. Right? We have so many fears. Don't you know it? Don't you know your fears? No? You're a rummy crowd - not know your own fears. Out of these fears you create gods. Right? Out of these fears you create rituals, spiritual hierarchies, gurus, all the temples of the world are out of fear. Right? And, fear of your wife, fear of your governor, fear of your policeman, you know, we've got thousands of fears. And we're asking, what is fear, not your particular form of fear. You understand, you understand sir? Not my fear and your fear, what is fear? If you understand the machinery of a car, you're not afraid of the car. Right? You know how to run it, when it should be serviced, and looked after and all the rest. So if you know, realize, understand, be with the nature of it, the cause of it, the root of it, then you will transcend fear, the fear is gone. Right? We're going to do that this morning.  We're asking what is fear, what's the cause of it, not how to end it, not how to transcend it, control it, depress it, and run away from it, as you're doing. So what is the cause the source of fear? Think it out, sir, go into it for a minute. Take your fear, your particular fear, or fears, what is the root of it? Security, desire for more, it's all, you understand? So, if you haven't found it, you will ask somebody, like the speaker, what is the cause of it? Will you listen, to it, listen, actually listen, as you listen to your boss, who might throw you out, give you less money, you listen? You listen with all your heart, with your fears, with your apprehension, you might lose your job, therefore please tell me what to do. Will you so listen to what he is saying? Or you say, yes. So I'll explain. May I? But you know how to do your job in an office. Right? So I'll explain. It's rather complex, and you like complexity. But, the explanation is not the thing. Right? The word fear is not fear. Right? The word is not the thing.  What is fear? What is the cause of it? Is the word fear the cause of fear? You understand? The word fear, does that evoke fear in you? Are you sure? So fear is a fact. And the word is not the fact. Right? Don't look puzzled, sir, it's simple, very simple. The word tree, is not the tree. So the explanation is not a means to end fear. So we have to examine then, what is time, because time is fear - tomorrow something might happen, my house might fall down; my wife might turn to another man; my husband has gone off and I'm in sorrow - fear. You understand? Fear of the past, fear of the future, fear of the present, anything might happen. So the past, the future and the present is caught in the wheel of time. Right? Right? Yesterday, today, and tomorrow is time. Right? I have been that, I won't be that, but I am not that now. Right? I have been, I shall be, but I am not. So the whole process is a movement in time. Movement means time. From here to there is a movement, and that means time to come from this place to that place needs time. So movement is time. All movement is time. Right? By the clock - come nearer sir, if you're in the sun sir, you too come and sit, there's plenty of room for god's sake. Don't be nervous, come close - so the past, the present, and the future is a movement which we call time. I was young once, now I'm ninety - this is time.  So what is time? What is time? It took you time to come from Benares to here. It'll take time for you to get back. So, there is time by the clock. Right? There is time to cover a distance, there is time as the past, the present, and the future. Right sir? All this is time. Right? The past shapes the present, right, circumstances and so on. Please, this is very difficult, don't agree or disagree, just listen, find out. The past is now operating. Right? And the future is shaped by the present, modified, circumstances have changed, certain incidents happen, so the past is modified, changed, altered. Right? And the future is what happens now. Right? So all time, the past, the present, and the future, is contained now. Ah, this puzzles you - go slowly, I'm not in a hurry. Sir, this applies to life, not just to theory. You are a Brahmin, oh sorry, you don't like Brahmins here. You were something yesterday, an incident takes place today that changes, modifies slightly, alters the past circumstances, the past, and the future is what you are now. Right? Modified. That's clear, isn't it? Or is this still a puzzle? That is, the past, the present, and the future are now. If there is no mutation now - you understand the word mutation - if there is no mutation now, you'll be exactly the same as you've been before. Right? I think I'm Indian, with all the circus behind it, and I'll be Indian again tomorrow. Right? That's logical, and that being Indian divides me from Muslim. Right? And I'll quarrel with him, not only for his land, increase of population and all the rest of it. So tomorrow is now. I can't go on explaining it to you. You understand this? So what you do now matters, much more than what you will do tomorrow. Right?  So what are you going to do? If tomorrow is now, that's a fact, it's not my theory or your theory, it's a fact: I am greedy now, if I don't do anything about it now, I'll be greedy tomorrow, that's all. Can I stop being greedy today? Right? Will you? No, of course not. So you will be what you have been. This is the pattern of humanity, for millions of years. You don't mind killing, be honest, you don't mind killing. You subscribe to it, you want your country to be strong. Right? Don't be ashamed of it, this is a fact. And so you gather armaments, you may not actually do it, you do it through tax, through buying a stamp, you support. Right? So, if you don't stop being an Indian now, you'll be an Indian tomorrow. So what are you going to do now? Oh you people, stop, you stop there. I'm asking what will you do now?  Q: Stop being an Indian.  K: Will you? You know what the implications are - not the passport, not the paper. Not to be associated with any country, not to be associated with any group, with any religion - they're all phoney anyhow. Is that possible, will you do it? Not you sir. Will you see the importance that if there is no mutation now, today, you'll be exactly the same tomorrow. This is not optimistic or pessimistic, this is a fact. For two and a half million years we have killed people. Right? As Buddhists, as Hindus, as Christians, perhaps Christians have killed more than anybody else. You're not Christian so I can easily say that! I've tackled this question in front of the Christians. So you understand the seriousness of it - don't play with it. If there is no radical mutation now, now, I'll be the same tomorrow.  So time is a factor in fear. Right? I'm afraid of what might happen tomorrow. I am afraid of not passing an exam. Right? A girl or a boy, wanting to pass some examination in order to have a better job, more money, a better chance, better this, says I'm going to work, work, work to pass that exam. I might not - fear comes in, and so on. Fear is a common factor of all mankind - it's not you, of all mankind. So can that fear, you understand, fear, not one branch of it, can the root of fear be totally demolished? That is, to have no fear of any kind. The speaker says it is eminently possible. That it can be done so radically. Either you kill the speaker, or you worship him, which are both the same. You understand? And that's what you're doing now. So, that's one of the factors of our life. And we have lived with fear for a million years, or more and we still carry on. So the speaker is saying, fear can be totally ended. Don't say it illumines one, and all that nonsense. You can end it if you put your brain, your heart into it, completely, not partially. And then you will see for yourself what immense beauty there is in it. A sense of utter freedom. Not freedom of a country, or some government, but the sense of enormity of freedom, greatness of freedom. Right? Will you do it, today, now? From today, seeing the cause of fear, end it. It is time. Time means thought, time is a movement, isn't it? We all agree, and thought is also a movement. Don't be dazzled by all this, it's very simple. Time is movement, thought is movement, so time is thought, and thought is time. Thought is based on knowledge, memory, experience, and so on, and time is also very limited in our life. As long as there is fear, biologically, physically, psychologically, it destroys us.  So, if one may ask, after listening to this fact, not theory, what are you going to do? Time is the factor of fear and thought, so if you don't change now, you won't ever change, ever again. This constant postponement. Right.	m

...But I want to write something; it's so much easier to write here when I'm angry or annoyed at something, even if I don't post what it actually is that gives me the motivation to rant on about things.  Right now I've not really got anything to be annoyed or angry at, I'm in a really good mood, here's how today has panned out.  Got to work early and decided to sort out my inbox, 3000 messages are just to many to seach through; I got as far as late October, where I found myself reading through old emails instead of sorting them; sometimes it's good to do that, just randomly open a couple of old emails and read, of course if you pick emails like the ones I've got then it'll probably take you a few hours.  Lunchtime was spent down the pub, and I'm totally amazed to have won two out of three games of pool. I've never been very good and as many people will tell you I almost always lose, but today, I just couldn't do a bad shot. I'd hit the ball, it would go all round the table and pot something, I was amazed :)  Returned to work to find a message saying the confirmed delivery date for my car is this Friday between 9am and 12 noon. I can't wait, not so much for the car itself, but just know I've got reliable transport again. I've got plans to meet up with a few old friends over the next month or so, and I was relying on getting the car in time.  Well that's about all that happened up to now. It's so nice that it's much cooler today, the heat was starting to get to me; probably go out for a walk again tonight, see what I can find to take pictures of.    Right that's enough for now, it's time I was cooking tea :)	m

"at the gym this morning, in the bodystyling class i took part in, one of the women around me smelt like airplane moisturiser.  moisturising lotion from airplanes. you know, that free, strongly smelling, either pinkish or off-white moisturising lotion that's in the bottles without screw-tops on economy class toilets on long-haul flights. you know, that stuff you only use when you've forgot to pack your own moisturiser in your hand luggage. you know, that stuff that smells so strongly that the entire toilets smell like it, too.  cathay pretends that what's in their little bottles is actually kanebo. but i doubt it. it has none of the traits of a good quality moisturiser, and that smell is so not kanebo, either. i personally suspect that airplane moisturiser comes from a 250 l barrel labeled ""airplane moisturising lotion with built-in toilet air freshener"" that is delivered with the airplane, straight from boeing ( buy one airplane, get two barrels of airplane lotion, free. choice of pink or white variety. ), accompanied by 8 little screw-top less bottles (one for each economy class loo) and an assortment of stick-on labels so the airline can disguise the origin of the lotion and pretend that it's high quality.  what else could explain how air new zealand, singapore and cathay all had lotion that smelled the same?  oh well.  so this morning, i worked out for an hour, a cloud of airplane lotion moving around the room. the smell breathtaking, giving me flashbacks of being cranky and tired, of dry air, dry skin, and queing for the loo, of leaving australia, of missing my boy. duh. unfortunately, i was unable to identify the culpit, the cloud was just too big, and surrounded a group of at least 6 women.  i wish bodystyling class came with a no smell, no perfume, no nothing rule, like yoga does.  just to prevent sad airplane travel flashbacks early on a sunday morning."	f

"**Mark 1:14-15--After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 'The time has come,' he said. 'The kingdom of God is near.  Repent and believe the good news!'""   It's a new thought to me that repentance is a POSITIVE thing.  It is portrayed negatively, for some reason, and people choose to ""rededicate"" rather than to repent.  What's the difference between repentance and rededication?  Rededication is a desire to try better next time, whereas repentance is a ""dramatic and decisive change of course"".  There is  action  inherent in repentance, whereas rededication is more like wishful thinking.    Yes, repentance is definately a necessary and ongoing part of the Christian life. Not only is it necessary, but it is GOOD and it shows God's loving nature. Afterall, repentance is a requirement of salvation (see Isaiah 30:15--""In repentance and rest is your salvation..."".  When I'm on a path toward destruction, God urges me to repent to save me from the consequences of sin.  He calls me to ""Repent and live!"" (Ezekial 18:32) When I'm in sin, God warns me by telling me to repent.  An unloving God will allow me to do what I want and put myself in danger.  I God who loves me enough to warn me of danger.    How does one repent?  Repentance involves a ""radical change in heart and mind.  It means that I agree with God's evaluation of my sin and take  specific action  to align myself with His will.  Again, the emphasis is on taking action to correct the deviation away from what is right.  So, repentance is 1) a mental acknowledgement that what I have done is wrong, 2) an acceptance of God's judgement, and 3) an action taken to align myself with His will. Note that is not a PLAN of action (that would be more like rededication), but an active response.  A desire to change is not repentance.  ""The evidence of repentence is not words of resolve, but a changed life.""  I can't tell you how good I am at giving God lip service.  At every girl's accountibility meeting, I tell everyone how terrible I feel about having a certain attitude or for doing/not doing such and such.  Then I go home and completely forget about my resolve to change.  I rededicate my life, but where is the change?!?  This means that I have not truely repented.  Honestly, I'm scared to even think about the things that I need to repent about.  I think I've become cynical about my ability to change myself, my attitude, and my habits.  It's not that I don't have enough will power (although that may be a contributing cause), but it's more like I'm not desperate enough to want change yet.  I know that God doesn't ask any more of me than I am able to give, so I think I should start small.  First, off I think that my relationship with M  D definately could use some improvement.  I haven't been good lately about calling them every week--maybe because I feel like we don't have much to talk about and they don't seem thrilled to hear from me.  But, I noticed that when I don't call, they notice. As a step in the right direction, I'm going to call them--right now."	f

After A while  After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul, And you learn that love doesnt mean leaning and company doesnt mean security, And you begin to learn that kisses arent contracts and presents arent promises, And you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open, with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child, And you learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans. After a while your learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much. So plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure. . . that you really are strong, and you really do have worth. And you learn and you learn. . . with every good-bye you learn. . .	f
The continued saga of the Pshyco person.  I text this person and no reply, so told the person got the hint.  Later the person apologizes and says didn't get the msg till two days later. Whatever...I got text msg before that, same frickin system.  Whatever, already...cut this person out...  Anyway, been hitting the gym this past weekend too. Feeling pretty sore, but it was a good burn.  CO is getting stronger, curled 90lb. Haha..i remember when we started, my max was 60lb, I think his was 70lb.  24hr is a good stress relief, other than drinking. haha.  EN took me out to lunch yesterday! It was nice of her and we bonded a little more.  We hardly hangout and when we do it's more of just small talk.  I had a nice time.  Last night had to do laundry...looking for clothes that I want to wear only to be in the laundry bin.  Took me the whole night after work doing the laundry and folding it afterwards.  Had to fold, don't like ironing so better to just hang it in the closet after the dryer.  Didn't feel the urge to go out after laundry, called CO to cancel lifting, but he was already going into the office to put in hours, he had jury duty, so had work to do afterwards.  That sucks.

Woo! For the rest of you who want some quick Cabbalistic Tree of Life info, go  urlLink here . This is so what I've been looking for.  In pure coinicidence,  Yesod ,the foundation, is represented in human anatomy by the phallus. (That's right girls, we have one more element of god than you do:P)  Now, Yesod is the medium for Tifaret(beauty) to unite with (actually, to try to unite with, which is important) Shekninah,(God's kingdom, the world we live in). The perverted of us cabbalistic acolytes(me), will notice that Tifaret is represented by the chest(yes, beauty is in the chest, god said so, tough luck girls who don't want breast implants) and Shekninah by the mouth(which is so cool and I don't want to get into why right now.) This means that the male phallus is a channel for the chest to connect with the mouth. Oh my! That's right everyone. The Tree of Life says that our world exists due to God having oral sex.   I'm a hippy. Oh well, at least I mentioned sex at least once in this post.	m

"By now, you’ve surely seen or heard the stories that Michael Jackson’s estate, Neverland Ranch, was searched by investigators on claims than another 12 or 13-year-old boy was molested while on the property. Police came armed with an arrest warrant with Jackson’s name along with 60 to 70 investigators. From dangling babies over the side of balconies to admittedly sleeping in the same bed as young children that he brings into his home, it’s about time someone or some agency investigated this man. I’ll agree that he was all the rage in the 80’s, but there is a limit! Oh, and I was watching the news this morning as I’m getting ready and I see that a few Wall Street brokers were arrested for taking commissions on deals that never went through. Bad brokers. Can’t really feel sorry for them since what they did was wrong and I see them as being a money-hungry type of person anyway. I guess it really doesn’t surprise me that they’ve finally been arrested.  On the war front, Chris  I have a friend who is in the Marines, Jeremy Lewis. He’s like 20 to 40 days away from getting out, but his group has been pulled to go to Iraq. I don’t know how long he’ll be there and I’m not sure he really knows either. Once he finishes over there, he’ll come back home and then he’ll have an additional 90 days left to complete. Then he’ll finally be released. I’ll be happy when that happens.   Interesting fact for you on this rainy Wednesday: The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe.  I read a story this morning on how women are getting their feet surgically altered in order to wear fashionable shoes. The surgeries are actually medically necessary or would be at some point. They are for removing corns, calluses, bunions, correcting hammertoes, etc., which I can’t knock. I think it was the quote at the end of the story by flight attendant Gloria Diaz: “I don't care what my feet feel like,"" she said. ""I will wear a beautiful shoe no matter how much it hurts if I have to, but now it doesn't have to hurt!"" (courtesy MSNBC.com)  OK, and finally for one of the most insane things I’ve heard/read lately: Hip-hop magazine, The Source, has accused Eminem, the rapper, of racism. He allegedly said, “Black girls are dumb, and white girls are good chicks” on an album that dates back to 1993. On the tape, he was rapping about his breakup with his black girlfriend. He said that he made it out of frustration right after their breakup. I’m not saying that he didn’t say this, but has ANYONE listened to his songs? Is this suddenly the only outlandish thing he’s done? The guy has been sued by his own mother – enough said. He’s always been followed by controversy. It’s what he does best.  Wait, I just read something else that, well, as Jerry Brown puts it, “makes your bootie wink”: A Texas baby is recovering Tuesday, one day after doctors at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park created an anal opening for him. Chief of Pediatric Surgery Dr. Alberto Pena performed the rare anorectal surgery on the 10-month-old baby boy Monday. The operation was teleconferenced live to Hadassah Hospital in Israel, where about 80 surgeons from Israel, Greece, Turkey and Italy watched. Pena developed the procedure and has done about 1,700 anorectal surgeries since 1986. He says the problem is a birth defect in which the anus and rectum do not develop properly. This type of malformation affects one in 5,000 newborns annually. (courtesy WNBC.com)  And finally, on this day in 1863: President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address."	f

I had this strange experience while flying out to Delhi from Bangalore. I got scared. Yes, that means I was scared the plane would crash before I could do all those  seriously cool things in life. Here's what I did prior to taking the flight. Maybe it will give a clue -  1. Read copiously about actress Soundarya's death by air crash. 2. Read the Prelude to Clive Cussler's Dragon which talks about a bomber crashing into the Pacific Ocean. 3. Starting reading former New York mayor Rudolf Guiliani's book on Sept 11th in which three planes crash, as you all know.  That very same morning I tried to vote. But since my name wasn't on the  rolls there was no use trying. Just accompanied my parents, and one friend to the booth and tried to steal a glance at an EVM.  Needless to say, a policeman stopped me before I could enter a booth without the pass.	m

"Job Search Frustrations   Today, on the way from my therapist appointment, I saw that the Longhorn restaurant on Dorothy Lane had just opened.  I went inside to get an application.  One of the managers told me to come back at 2 PM this afternoon so that we could talk about a bartending position.  I filled out the application, and got changed for the interview.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the gentleman with whom I spoke earlier wasn't available.  I talked with another manager/partner, who told me, ""If you had only been here 3 weeks ago...""  This was not what I needed to hear, but I finished the meeting gracefully.  Then I went to the bartending school just to check in.  The manager there told me to call her back before 5 PM today.  I then went to ""Restaurant Row"" along Miller Lane to obtain and complete applications at restaurants I had not previously applied to earlier.  It was a ""learning experience.""  Many of these restaurants do not hire bartenders, but instead hire servers who later get ""promoted"" to bartenders.  I told one proprietor of a certain ""Austrailian-themed"" restaurant that I was willing to be a server, but he basically said that, unless I had 2 to 3 years of experience serving I shouldn't even consider completing an application for his restaurant.  I asked him if he knew where I could go to get this experience he was looking for.  He didn't have any idea.  I was very upset and frustrated at what he said, and my whole saga of finding a job, by this time.  He offered his hand for me to shake, and, at first, I didn't want to do it, but I resisted the urge to be rude and shook it anyway.  As I walked out, I thought about getting some rotten eggs and returning to the restaurants.  I won't, though.  I came home and vented.  You may be aware that I have a blog called "" urlLink Letters to God .""  It is a great way for me to pray, and I feel better for having done it.  Much better than I would have if I, say, found some rotten eggs, if you know what I mean.  I could probably continue this post for a little while, but I guess I'll end it here.

38 km.  Back from the country, all sunburned. As it always happens to me, my rear tyre started going flat just at the right moment. I managed to ride on saturday but with a tire in the middle of going flat. As one might expect, it takes a lot more effort to move a bike with a flattish tire. But it was sort of fun because i got to ride upright for a long distance (because one can put more power to the pedals that way) and that kept the speed up. Fun.  I had planned to do 100 km on sunday but the tyre was flat. As it tends to happen to me, my pump is broken, too. And i didnt feel like going into the village looking for a pump either. You'll never know what the locals might be up to.  Instead of biking, i went to the beach. Now my legs are red and a little stingy.  [music: Aphrodite - I Got Five On It]	m

hello all of you,                         I am a student of PFM batch 2006 at IIFM.I am from Gomoh,Dhanbad,Jharkhand.I have completed my graduation from indore.  I want to  share my experience of my first day at iifm.As i was in a management college already,getting into iifm was a conscious decision for me.When i had come for gd/pi to iifm,i was enchanted by the environment out here.I had subconsciously made my mind that i will join iifm.First day was full of excitement and thrill of not only seeing the campus,buildings but also here and there natural creatures like snakes,lizards etc.,infact it was the first time experience for many of us to actually see these so near.The faculty out here is very cooperative,and understanding.And iifm actually provides ample scope in its sector not only in india but also in whole world.Actually i have already started thinking that how will i live after getting out of iifm,leaving the pollution free environment,salubrious food and cooperative faculties.With our arrival also the Director Sir has come to iifm,and I am looking forward to the day when IIFM reaches its culminating heights.thanks all                                                                                                      Ranjan kumar	m

From the ERIC Digest:  The effective use of representations in mathematics and science education has gained more importance as we enter the new millennium. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics even added, Representation, to their four process standards which ""highlight ways of acquiring and using content knowledge"" (NCTM, 2000, p.29) in their new reform document, ""Principles and Standards for School Mathematics"". Even though all types of representations are being encouraged in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science, graphical representations play a special role.   Graphs can summarize very complex information or relationship very effectively. Although graphs are explicitly taught in mathematics classrooms as an end in themselves, many subject areas such as science or social studies utilize graphs to represent and interpret relationships. So being able to interpret or construct graphical representations is a crucial skill for every student whether they want to pursue science or mathematics related careers. However, many researchers detected that many students lack graphing skills.   Brasell and Rowe (1993) studied high school physics students' graphing skills and they concluded that ""[students] do not understand the fundamental properties and functions of graphs in representing relationships among variables."" Their facility with graphs was generally superficial, grounded on a few, simplistic algorithms such as plotting data points"" (p. 69). Janvier was one of the first mathematics educators to mention the problems that students have in interpreting graphs (Bell  Janvier, 1981; Janvier, 1981). Mostly he argues how global meanings of graphs and interpreting graphs are left out in mathematics classrooms, while reading data and constructing and reading certain points on graphs are emphasized."	m
"All three of us are back from Virginia.  Dad and I went up to Donna's house to pick Mom up from her ""vacation"".  We left up there at about 2:30am and got home at about 8:15.  Since today was a ""weigh-in"" day, I decided to change and go jogging.  The jog began like any other.  The weather was warm and the azaleas were in full, fragrant bloom.  I got near the Post Office, and tripped on some uneven sidewalk.  Well, I went down like a sack of anvils.  Luckily, I didn't break anything except my pride.  I felt like an utter fool!  My walkman came out of the pocket on my hoodie, and I landed on my left knee and hand.  I scraped the skin off the left knee.  I also scraped the skin off two knuckles (middle  ring) on the back of my left hand as well as a patch of skin off the fat pad next to the thumb on the inside of that hand.  I'm all bandaged up now, but until I walked (not jogged) home, I was a bloody mess.  I dressed my wounds, took to arthritis Tylenol and am trying to ignore my sore knee.  I know nothing is seriously wrong because I can bend and walk on it.  It's just REALLY sore and tender.  I'm so glad it didn't swell up.  After that, I did weigh-in.  I was pleased to see that I lost 3.5 of the 4 pounds I gained last week.  Unfortunately, the scale said I gained 2% bodyfat.  I just can't win, can I?  Oh well, at least I lost weight.  Mom and I went to the commissary when it opened at 11.  Since we hadn't gone in the two weeks Mom was away, our bill came to 180 dollars.  Then, all three of us went to Sam's Club.  Now I think I might go lay down.  I'm so tired from leaving Donna's at 2:30."	m

Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Whoever made that up was lacking a few crucial brain cells. Sometimes I feel like I am waiting continuosly for the next step of my life. Maybe it's the rain and maybe it's hormones but when you haveso much time on your hands you tend to be melancholy. I live three-thousand miles from family. Five hours from my husband. I never realised how little I have in common with most people until I tried to make friends.I really want friends but I can't seem to find anyone who shares a love of John Steinbeck and Simon andGarfunkel. I am twenty-six.All the girls my ageare so obsessed withthe dumnest things.Idon't know what to do. I feel like I am so alone and everytime I try to make friends with people Iget stabbed in the back. I seem to have this concept of morals and accountibility that has gone out of vogue when I wasn't looking. Women are so catty. Iam too straight- forward.Does anyone else ever feel this way?	f

Tiff I got the Pics! Thanks so much! Everyone loved them. Michelle you are on my calendar and I will be there if at all possible! I am getting sad. It is my last day with my office mate as she is moving up to where all the cool people are. I will have a new one when I come back from Oklahoma but its just not the same. I also have a final this afternoon and have done little to no preparation for it. I guess its good that its open note open book. I have written the first six pages of my thesis although I am supposed to have 12. Oh well I don't care. I just am excited that I am going home! Or not home but to a new home. Its going to be totally strange. But that is my life right now. Not much cool going on but things will really pick up when I get back.	f
I just got back from school a few hours ago. Sat my OCR Mechanics 1 paper. It was not good. I didn't like it except for the last question, which was the one I thought I'd get stuck on so I revised that one like crazy.. and the other questions turned out to be worse. Sigh, guess today wasn't that much of a perfect day. I was jittery and had pre-exam nerves. It really wasn't my day.  Here's an interesting article: ( urlLink click , courtesy of  Brandon )  Regular sex helps students  A German sociologist Werner Habermehl says regular sex can help university students pass exams and get better grades.  Habermehl from the University of Hamburg said he and his team had tested students before and after sex.  They found that regular sexual activity significantly increased mental capability, but they found celibate students found it harder to make the grade.   As well as decreasing the length of time needed to complete a course, students with a healthy sex life also received better marks, said Habermehl.  The research was carried out together with German research institute GEWIS. *giggle* Sigh, anyway.. I'm currently chatting with  Brandon , we're talking about the mechanics exam.  Rach  is online as well, we're talking about her exam..read the tagboard to get a vague idea how she's feeling. Anyways, I'm going out with  Kaka Fizah  tomorrow to watch Harry Potter and her brothers' might join us, I'm not that sure. I'm meeting up with  Khalid  and maybe  Hadi  before that though. Oh, my best friend's back. YAY  Reza Mustappa  is back. YAY. YAY. YAY. I'm gonna see him on Friday. YAY. YAY. YAY. After one year of not seeing him in the flesh, let's hope he's bulked up ;D ehe mwahs.  missed ya babyjoe. hugs.   I've got a lot on my mind right now. I don't know why I'm hurting so much.. I can't really start pointing fingers. It's just not right. I'm thinking about the promises I've been given by people, most of them have been broken. I guess that's why I don't bring myself to make promises to anyone because I know there will be a point when I can't keep them. Everything feels like a burden right now, my head hurts and I feel like crying. It's not right is it?  I remember dating this guy who used to tell me I was his world. I always wondered if girls actually fell for that line the way I did. I guess I was too guilble to see what was really going on around me because to me, he was my world. As a result of having 'love' blind me, I had everything that had meant  everything  turn around and slap me. Now, eventhough I can say that I have slowly moved on (not fully, but I'm getting there), I know I will always think back every now and then.. because that's part of life.. reliving memories.   I've got beautiful friends. They do mean  something  to me.. and yet, they still cannot see what really goes on in my eyes. I don't really confide in people that much, not even to my closest friends. I find it hard to let people see what happens inside of my morbid thoughts because I don't know how to trust people that much anymore. You see, almost four years ago.. I saw my life shatter in front of me.. I had my heart broken. I know that as of that point in time, I will never trust anyone as much as I used to. blegh.  Geez, I wonder why I'm still up at this time of night. I think I'll go to bed now.. I miss  Ade  and  Rach . I wonder how you girls are doing? Nyah. I wish you would use the commenting system =P I mean, that's what its there for right? hehe hugs. I put it up for  ADE  and the other people who TAGGED and said that I SHOULD put it in. God I miss you two..	f

Received a call in the morning, was told that due to some unforseen circumstances, piano could not be scheduled to deliver today.... so sad... when released the news to Honey, she was kinda sad too.... was told that they could only make delivery on next Tuesday (20th Jul 2004)instead. Time passes slowly as it reaches around 11++a.m Somebody knocked on the door  tada! Piano has arrived, it looks so nice, so elegant  Honey was eagerly playing with it the moment it was being setup. Tidied the whole bedroom eventually  have the piano moved in... Honey was so excited the whole day that she sms her friend to share the joy...	m

So I went home for lunch, walked and all.  I say if I want food, I need to work for it.  I didn't even want to stop since I ate so much last night, but my arms and legs started shaking and I knew I wouldn't last until 7 tonight.  I couldn't believe how shaky I was, it was getting worse the closer to my place I got.  On the way, I had considered doing an all cereal food regime since it would control my calories really well (one box per day is about 2000 calories).  Well, I'd need to be sure its a low sugar high fiber cereal, because the cereal I had this morning made me so hungry and shaky by noon I couldn't do that every day.  Cat enjoyed me being home for just a couple minutes.  I don't know how she's going to handle me being on vacation for two weeks.  It will be so lonely. :(  Maybe Cindy and Laura can take turns staying with her?  So my mother IMed me and was telling me about her dentist visit today.  She goes to my dentist too, and since I went yesterday they were raving over how wonderful a person I was:   Mom : I went for my cleaning this morning and they were all oohing and ahhing about what a nice young man you are  Mom : they said you were every mother's dream of a son in law  Mom : I said does that mean he didn't cause a scene and throw a fit?  Mom : they LOVE you  Mom : even Mr Dr thakrar said he saw you and what a nice fellow you were.  Mom : I said that you took after your mother  Mom : I did hear she was a nice person  My mom makes me laugh sometimes.  I can't even go to the dentist without being harassed, if even a day late!  So I opened my new money market account and put my six months saved income into it.  You're supposed to have nine, so we'll see how that goes.  It has a 2.15% interest rate and its harder to get to than a checking/savings account, so we'll see how that goes.  Mom was telling me about all the wonderful (read expensive) things we'll be doing out in CA for two weeks.  Dodger's game, boat trip to Catalina Island, San Diego zoo.  Should be fun.  I have to water all my plants.. eek.. two weeks, so much goes on during two weeks.  And I'm going to be away....  After helping my mom with my uncle's website, she wrote:  Mom : you are the best!  Mom : but I already knew that because the dentist's office told me this morning.  Something to make me smile. :)  Also, Sheila called and wants to go to Golden Port tonight at 6:15, so that's something to look forward to.	m
Current Obsession: Work   Here's how it works at my place of employ: if you ask for a raise, you have to take on more responsibility. In other words, you could go well above the call of duty, take on multiple projects, grow in a thousand different directions, THEN ask for a raise as compensation. You won't get it. However, if you sit on your butt all day, barely lifting a finger, then say you'll work if you're given more money, you'll get the raise. I think I've just been screwed.    Ya really think I've got a raise comin'? Puh-lease!	f

Oh and did I mention that Jesseca Wales is the coolest girl and she rocks my world?  I'm not even tired right now even though I was up until like 2 a.m. last night, if not later. I am so happy about that too, because I was not looking forward to being tired all day. Ya know what else is interesting? I'm not even doing my work right now even though there are three assignments do at the end of class. Now that is not cool.

"Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's ""Homage to Catalonia"" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the ""villanous"" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years! Gee, and the policies of neutrality and appeasement certainly didn't help in Spain, or in Czechoslovakia for that matter. Or in Poland, etc. ""It just goes on and on and on.""

Dobby spells trouble for himself . Dobby, the computer-animated elf in the new Harry Potter film, could be at the centre of a court battle over his resemblance to Russian president Vladimir Putin.    Isn't the resemblance too uncanny?!!! :)  A Russian law firm is reportedly drawing up legal action against the special effects people who dreamt up Dobby, arguing that the ugly but caring elf has been modelled on Mr Putin. The Kremlin and Warner Bros, producer of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, have declined to comment but the controversy has stirred emotions in Russia.  Potter websites and chatrooms have been inundated with angry Russian messages attacking anyone suggesting a likeness between the elf and Mr Putin.

Group A  Portugal need to pull something special against Spain with their only points comming against the hapless Russians. Whoever wins in the Spain vs Portgual match go through. If Portugal loses its curtains for them. If spain loses, the only way though for them is a lost of at least 2 for Greece but seeing how well the Greeks are playing and how poorly the Russians are playing, Spain will definately be playing for the win or a draw. If Portgual vs Spain is a draw, Portgual will be relying on Greece to lose to make it through. Russians are already eliminated so no comment for them.  Match to watch: Spain vs Portgual    Group B  The only way for Switzerland to go through is by beating France 4-0, but I won't be seeing that happen. England vs Croatia is a crunch match, whoever wins goes through and whoever loses its out for them. An England draw should see them through. France only require a draw to get through and even a loss might see them through if England vs Croatia ends in a draw.  Match to watch: England vs Croatia    Group C  1-1 Italy vs Sweden leaves Italy on 2 points after 2 games. They'll (Italy) pull through if they beat Bulgaria and either Sweden or Denmark get a win. But if Sweden vs Denmark is a draw, Italy needs to win at least 2-0 thats if the draw is 0-0 or 1-1, if its 1-1, im not sure whats going to happen because they would be on same goal difference with same amount of wins and the corresponding fixture between them was a draw. Interesting, somebody fill me in on that? You would say Sweden has a good chance of going through but if Denmark wins and Italy wins, they are out :/  Match to watch: Sweden vs Denmark    Group D  Its a bit too early to call, theres only been one game each for them. Even Latvia can win it from this stage. Group of death this group is.  Match to watch: Netherlands vs Czech Republic, this match should help shape the table   Tight groups so far, nobody has that special 6 points after two games.  My tippings for each group:  Group A : Greece and Spain  Group B : France and England  Group C : Sweden and Denmark  Group D : Czech Republic and too early too call	m
Okay, I'm starting to think that we need to get Sophia a massive Thorazine drip. I'm sorry I missed the thespian play, I was in Chicago and I got brochures out the wazoo.

Bonjour, everyone, I am back from my wonderful, rainy trip in Quebec. Wanna know why I'm back two days early? Because the weather was so facking bad we all just got fed up and left.  The Minshall family is a bunch of quitters. Deal with it :D   Mostly I bought jewellery.. *shifty eyes* I'm trying to find the PERFECT RING to replace the one I lost. I haven't actually succeeded yet... but I have found lots of  other  rings that are nice and pretty ^^;; I also have billions of bracelets, too. Cool, ne? I am pleased, to say the least. And a nice cross necklace, too. I haven't turned manic-Christian, don't worry :P The cross has been around a long time before Jesus. Everyone seems to forget that. You know Odin was hanged and nailed upon the Yggdrasil and speared in the side, too? Way before Jesus ever came along? And he was  sacrificing himself , no less! Now does that sound uncannily like plagiarism, or what? He has the coolest nickname ever: Lord of the Gallows. Neat, huh?   YAY LIBERALS WON!!! And I'm not sure -- but didn't the Green Party get a seat? HOLY SHITE was it not just absolutely hilarious / terrifying when the Marxist-Lennonist party was AHEAD in that Mississauga riding?!?!?! My cousins live there... *cries* *falls off chair laughing* *is confused* That was just... strange. In your face, Harper. That's for believing your own press!! He thought he'd get a  majority , the eedjeet. I have no patience for imbeciles.   This election also brings to light why proportional representation would so totally work better than first-past-the-post. Bloc Quebecois had 12% of Canada's vote. They got 54 seats. The NDP had 14% of Canada's vote. They got 19 seats. How is that fair?? grr. Of course the Liberals don't want pro. rep., because then they'd be even worse off than they are now... lol. Least they won, that's all I can say. lol, I saw this sign advertising Harper in Quebec City, and there was some pretty crazy (funny) grafitti: a Hitler moustache, and the words FASCIST scrolled across it. The Frenchies might be voting for an idiot, but at least they know Harper's worse. *big grin*   Among other things... I can't actually see my blog. IE is screwed, and Mozilla, for some odd reason, isn't showing my blog past the song lyrics. Blah. So, if anyone is writing anything on my chatterbox for whatever reason, that's why. And yes, ei is Caleigh. I think I'm worse than A on all counts, BTW ^^;;; Mwahaha! Go screw yourselves if you don't like it! All my friends love me, and people who aren't my friends I really don't care about, to tell ya the truth... hee, and if it wasn't Peter and Timur, I'm sorry =D Although knowing what I know about the two of you, you can hardly blame me for assuming, ne? (even if assumptions are bad) (so I'll apologize for assuming) (but not for assuming it was YOU TWO) (if that makes sense)   Did you know Chateau Frontenac was like its own city?? We stayed at the Auberge St. Pierre, but jeeeez. It was huge. And there were these two cute juggler guys on the first or second night there, too. Which was cool. I think they were students. I still think Montreal is way prettier though; Quebec has a great old town, but outside of that it's pretty normal. Long live Montreal!!   And then we went to... Chevralier or something? Anyway, we stayed at the Richelieu hotel. It was an hour away from an awesome whale-watching cruise, and that was just unbelievable. We saw an insanely huge amount of whales; a blue whale, too, the largest whale in the world and the first sighting of one this season. Woo! Out at sea for 4 hours though... it was damn cold. And the fjord (forget its name) was just beautiful, too. I don't think my da took enough pictures *pouts* He keeps insisting on  people  being in the picture, and I think that's just ridiculous...   We also went to see the St. Anne Gorge (or canyon)? I had no idea my dad was afraid of heights!!! It was hilarious. 3 suspension bridges over some of the worst white water in Canada, in this huge canyon... it was beautiful, and terrifying, at the same time. *shudders* I think we got some good pictures though. And I walked 400+ steps to be I think 9m over the river... *whew* but I beat my dad! Who works out like every weekend! *cheers*   My mum and my sister are doing an exercise and diet regime. I'm in shock. I feel very left out. But also proud, because I will never ever be caught dead eating a grape fruit, you freaks.   Other than that... I love my dog, she's wonderful and the best. I can't speak French for beans but I'm getting better. And I hate sitting in the car. :P A la prochaine!	f

Were all on this journey, hoping to reach a destination, and its a journey without a map to give us any direction, so we walk around aimlessly trying to find our way.  When we think we found a path to get us there, sometimes it winds up being a dead end.  And what then, you have two choices turn around and wonder how you got lost or to keep moving forward hoping that the next path you run across will be the one that leads you there. I'll be taking my steps forward, because I still have many miles to go till I reach that destination.	m

Helped out at VBS (Vacation Bible School) tonight... that was... interesting.  The people who are running it this year... well, they put it off til the last minute and it shows... big time!  The music program is pretty bad... the whole program is pretty bad.  They have ALL age groups doing music at once.  That is impossible to do... and I know, because I've worked with kids forever... you have to do things in different age groups... the little kids don't learn at the same rate as the 4-5th graders... ya know?

"The only barrier/sterotype that will not be overcome   By Mark Connolly Editor, Dallas Bureau  I wish to posit that virtually all struggles between peoples can be reduced to real or perceived differences between those that see themselves as having, and those that see themselves as having not. This cannot be oversimplified into a generic all-encompassing statement about anyone or any society however. Just like a man ‘Jim’ can at once be both Father and Son, each person or group or society can at one time be among the Haves, and at another time be among the Have-nots as those are defined within relationships. There are the rich that have plenty to eat everyday, as compared to those that do not. There are the rich that drive BMW’s as compared to those that drive an old jeep bought at auction from the Post Office. There are the rich that own Gulf Stream business jets as compared to those that can only afford LearJets.  There are those that are Christian as opposed to Pagans. Those that are Moslems as compared to the Infidels. One supposes to have the truth while the other are supposed to have not. There are those that have light skin and those that have not. There are those that have freedom as compared to those that have not.  And reverse all of those depending on your personal situation. Today in Iraq there is no doubt that there are those people that preferred the (in retrospect) stability and safety of the old dictatorship as compared to the (current) utter chaos of ‘freedom.’  On the global stage, (I think) America is largely perceived as having, and much of the world is perceived as having not. But what America is perceived as having varies widely. We have wealth, we have debauchery. We have freedom, we have arrogance. We have charity, we have unbridled greed. We have the best intentions, we have the worst intentions. (Hmmmm, that sounds familiar somehow… best times worst times, perhaps a novel in there somewhere?)  All of this wouldn’t matter much if it didn’t engender hatred as a collateral effect of noticing these differences. And that is the part of this that I don’t understand, and wonder if it can be dealt with. Even among my own family differences of opinion can flash into anger. And we are all from the same basic socio-economic-religious background!  I believe People tend to think in a collage of future probababilities that range from downright fantastic to very pragmatic. But we emote in the now, often in a very disconnected way, and then use the awesome power of our minds to validate the emotion of the moment. That can become exhausting, physically and emotionally, hence the phenomenon “Birds of a feather flock together.”  Are we, should we, can we, be a global flock? I’m not sure there is enough common ground for determining the basic issues. So, I wonder if that is a realistic concept. And I don't believe it feasible to simply distribute everything equally and  Oila! , no problems. You'll not get any agreement on what is important and what needs to be distributed equally. Because someone will see themselves as having the right to distribute and someone else as not being equipped to decide.  The reason I think all this matters is because I believe that it is only in consideration of these concepts that the issue of Terrorism can be dealt with or resolved. Who or what is a terrorist? Well, among other things a terrorist is also a mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter. They may or may not belong to this or that branch of some religion or race. They may be 'disenfranchised' in reality or in their minds. Or someone else's mind.  We focus on Arab/Muslim today, due to current events. But there are terrorists in Japan, Ireland, America, etc. It is pretty clear to me that the motives and methods of a ""terrorist"" in Ireland are not identical to those in Iraq. So, the class of  Terrorist  is insufficiently defined, and consequently oversimplified at the moment to someone in a turban.  People often rush to Answers without considering the Questions. Some questions I have been asking myself are:  What is the source of terrorist behavior? Is there common ground for dialog? Is there potential for common dialog? If not, what then? Why 'terrorism' instead of some other avenue? Would someone recognize another potential avenue even if presented?   And then, what if the motive is simply extermination of Infidels? What is the civilized response? Historically, it has been kill or be killed. Can we move beyond that?   What is to be done about it in a world that will perennially be populated by Haves and Have-nots?  Genocide or Religicide cannot be the answer.  Ψ"	f

"Posted to the Academy membership e-mail list a short time ago...    Dear Academy Members:  As you know, Matt Forbeck is heading a taskforce to look at the Origins Awards. There has been discussion within the taskforce mailing list as to the function of the Academy. There is even a possibility that the Academy may not exist after the taskforce recommendations.  I have asked Nicole Lindroos to step down as Academy Chair. I will not be asking anyone to step into the role to replace her. Until the GAMA Board of Directors hears the taskforce recommendations, the Academy is without a purpose. In the taskforce recommendations, we will either find that the Academy has a new and invigorated mandate, or no mandate at all. If it turns out to be the latter, I don't want someone left ""holding the bag."" Nicole Lindroos has done excellent service to GAMA and the Academy, and I do not wish any future actions of I or the Board of Directors tarnishing that.  If the taskforce does recommend that the Academy continue, and with an invigorated mandate, I will name a new Chair at that time.  The Academy Chair will remain empty until further notice.  Thank you.  Don Perrin --  Don Perrin GAMA President www.gama.org    This turn of events was not unexpected, but I remain sad to see that all the work I've done for the last year stands to be swept aside and done away with nonetheless. A year of my life, shamelessly wasted.  Squandered.    Don't I feel foolish..."	f
I'm pretty sure I have posted both of these before, but:   sesame noodles:  cooked spaghetti noodles (i like thin spaghetti) rinsed in cold water  in a gallon-size ziplock baggie, combine: 1/4 cup sesame oil 2-3 tbsp  urlLink Sriracha sauce  (chili sauce) 1-2 tbsp  urlLink fish sauce  1-2 tbsp sweet sauce (or 1 tbsp sugar) (You can find the sweet sauce with the other sauces  bottles of flavorings in most any vietnamese or asian grocery) 2-3 tbsp  urlLink rice wine vinegar  juice of 1/2 a lime 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger 2 tablespoons water (this is not an exact science--you make it to your tastes.  Key elements in asian cooking are balancing the sweet, the salty,  the spicy.)  put cold noodles in ziplock baggie with sauce, shake 'em around, soak for 2-3 hours, then let them get room-temp before serving. garnish with sesame seeds and chopped basil and cilantro.         coleslaw:  in gallon-size ziplock baggie, mix: 1/4 cup salad oil (vegetable, corn, whatever) 2 tbsp sesame oil 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 2-3 tbsp sweet sauce (or 1 tbsp sugar) 2 tbsp lime juice black pepper red pepper flakes --combine well.  add one finely-sliced head of regular cabbage, let sit in fridge for 1-2 hours, stir in chopped fresh basil and fresh shredded carrots just before serving.  garnish with sesame seeds.	f
it's amazing what one can do when there's just a little thought applied to the process. ten-key, people go to school for this sort of thing. it only took me a few minutes to learn the basics - where everything is.   haven't heard from a. in a long. slightly worried she might be avoiding me. maybe she hasn't and i'm a fool to think she is. of course it's all about me.   it's gay pride here in sc. i don't have any pride for anything. i don't feel anything. i am nothing, and i think i like it that way for now. there is nothing happening in my life where i need to make any decisions. i'm not hoping or wanting for anything or anyone, although sometimes i can get emotional - like any of us can.  last night i had a god moment watching joan of arc. she believed but she maybe, according to the movie believed what she wanted to believe in some cases. it's very easy to mystify religion and shift into some world only you and a few other living souls live in. it's sad. they look down on others who are not apart of their world.   there's a tiny fragment of a relationship with god dwelling somewhere in me. i don't trust myself to let it out completely since I was so broken and feel betrayed from it. i can't rush it. things will be fine. i'm still here. i'm, not going anywhere - i just hiding from the public yey.	f

"2 days no blog , anybody miss me???  anyway, i was at a camp instructor training camp for the last 2 days with Innotrek at Jalan Bathera Campsite. Quite a nostalgic place cos used to have my sec 3 camp there almost 8 yrs ago. THe place changed alot.It was really an enriching training for me and i managed to see the professionalism and enthu in the company and instructors. One main thing i've learnt is that outdoor camps are not the same as what we have gone thru while we are in sec school anymore..Also learnt many skills pertaining to be an INSTRUCTOR. It is not just a imparting of skills to trainees anymore. It is very much more of facilitating while imparting the skills.I've learnt alot from the senior instructors who showed us the ropes especially Annuar, Eunice, Raziman (not sure if i got the name correct...haha) and Bob. They were a fantastic bunch of people. Hope to work with them soon.  Got my exam results today. As usual filled with ups and downs. Got an A-, 3Bs and one B-. Though acceptable results, i am rather disappointed with one module. Singapore's Foreign Policy,  which i feel should be much better than a B, considering the amount of effort and daily performance i have put into the module. Quite surprising for 2 modules which i did much better than expected. In the module of "" Nation building in Singapore"", i've got a A-. I tot an A- is not possible after screwing up one major question in the exam. In another module ""COntemporary social issues in Singapore"", this was the biggest surprise. I did not do well in both the group project and individual essay prior to the exam, they were disastrous in fact. In addition, i did not attend lectures the whole sem and for tutorials is just to mark attendence oni...neber do the tutorials at all. Also didn't do much reading for the exams....oni know that it was an open book exam the day before the paper. Surprise Surprise i managed to smoke thru the paper and score a B. Once again it proved that NUS marking system always gives plenty of surprises. I neber manage to predict my results correctly for the last 2 yrs, gave up on predicting liao...hahahaha  very sleep liao...stay tuned for the next episode   Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know"	m

Dear Lei     It is Saturday night here. The first night that I know you will not be online for some time. I am missing you already. I have my ICQ on, in the hope that maybe I will see you. ;-) Remember you said things were moving fast? Well there is two ways that you can look at my time line. The first way is to look at how long I have known you. Granted not very long. So in that aspect you could say things are moving quickly. The other way you could look at it is this way. I have been online for 4 years as a single male. I have talked to a lot of females in that time. It has been a long time since I have had these kinds of feelings for anyone. If you look at it that way, you could say that this has not happened to me very quickly. I do not want to rush you in to anything. All I am asking for is a chance? Let us see how things play out. Maybe just maybe things will go the way, I think that you and I would like them to go. It will take time and patients on our part. It will take a little money on my part. If you have the time and patients, I will come up with the money. Well i am gonna go for tonght. Hoping that you are having fun and that you are safe.     Je t'aime     Kevin	m

Yesterday was full of super ultra highs and way down dirty dirty lows. (I'd like one day of normalicy, please.)  As we know from yesterday's post, the morning was brilliant and shiny. Just the way I like my mornings. At some point after lunch, I slipped into a deep and terribly damp dungeon. Not how I care for my days to go.  (s)Mother has run away from home. No, really. My Mom has run away. (And she doesn't understand when I drive aimlessly around town.) I'm secretly stashing cash for her and now she's run away. Not joking. Seems the problems between her and Mito are only getting worse. I'm worried and frustrated and unsure how to help. Then I realized that I've lost my pay ticket for this month's house payment. They won't send me a new one without Gramma's social security number. How am I suppose to pay this? Gr. Stupid Washington Mutual. I had to tell Christabelle that I won't be in Dallas this month. She cried. I miss her so much, but I'm going to see her soon. Hell, I'll be sending her an invitation, soon. But I'm getting ahead of myself.... Things picked up again after work and I took Lia to the grocery. Yea. Now we have food. I took Monkeypants dinner and flowers. He nonchalantly said the killer nine words which devestated me, broke my heart, shattered my very breath:   I'm going to spend time with the boys tonight.	f

I had a really, really bad day.  =.=  Right now I'm designing a layout for Sorata's fanlisting and I can't think of a  thing .  So I thought I'd take a break and blog.  =)  In case I don't get around to dropping by tomorrow to leave this note, Platypus and I are holding off blogging from Monday to Thursday of next week.  Then we're both (reportedly and assuming Platypus doesn't forget) going to write our life stories (as a figure of speech, mind) in celebration of our year-long... attendance of this blog.  =D  See how our archives go back to May 28, 2003?  ^_^   [ music ]  Wei- One More Angel  So, today.  First Elfie wakes up at 10:20 because she's  dead tired  and slept really, really late last night.  Then Elfie just lies there in bed because that's what Elfie does for the first two hours that she's awake.  But then Mummy and Johnny kick the door open and tell Elfie she has tennis in  forty minutes  and she has to leave in  twenty .  So then Elfie has to get up and change and all that crap and goes to tennis.  Then the tennis teach gives Elfie a SPIDERMAN RACKET and expects Elfie to play tennis with it.  What the hey?  It's a Spiderman racket!  Then Elfie misses the first, oh, six hundred shots the tennis teach hits at her because this retarded Spiderman racket is the most oddly shaped thing in the world.  So tennis goes on for about forty minutes, then Elfie's grandmother comes and picks Elfie up.  She dumps Elfie at her house, where she sits staring into space for forty minutes before Mother-dear comes with food.  And then Elfie ate.  And all was good.  Not.  So now it's 12:20, and Elfie's got piano lessons at the half hour.  She gets to piano lessons, and lo and behold, teacher is in a BAD MOOD.  Now Elfie has to endure an hour of bitchslapping and verbal abuse.  Then, to make all matters worse, Teacher makes Elfie play the Czerny etude for Elfie's CM requirements.  That etude is the most disgusting song ever.  It sounds, oh, roughly like five cats scraping their claw nails against a blackboard in unison.  Add the occasional discordant chord (no pun intended), and you've got Elfie's piano piece.  It sounds better when it's played wrong, but the teacher made Elfie play it right.  Then Elfie had to go to CHOIR.  But the Pumpkin got sick this morning, so she couldn't go and Elfie had to go alone to the stupid place.  We got there and Elfie was bored for a very, very long time.  And then Elfie went home.  And here I am.  The End.	f
"I'm starting this post at 9:01 p.m.  Let's see how long it takes for me to bitch about my fucked-up day...  I do not understand my current state of bitchiness:  should  not  be PMS-ing (if I am, I'm fucked, because it's too soon, and I don't want to go back on hormones again), got enough sleep (too much), Buzzy hurt his leg and ended up spending the entire day at the vet ($267), my truck's rotors went out (what the fuck are rotors anyway? are they important? why do they eat my belts? I HATE AUTOMOBILES!), I spent too much at Pier I and Barnes  Noble last night, I want more perfume from Sephora (Cacherel's ""Amor, Amor!""), my head hurts, I think I'm re-catching my cold (sorry that I gave it to you, Vicente), I have a friend in need, sorta hungry but not motivated to cook, I really don't like being an adult (except for the smoking, drinking, sex parts), wish I could find my piano lesson books from 4th grade, want to get slovenly drunk but have to go to work in the a.m., worry about $$$ incessantly, I'm thinking of packing up and moving to a warmer/animal-friendly state, feel  very  misunderstood, think I need a much more creative job, I ate fabulous Mahi-Mahi tacos today who feel the need to spawn up my throat, miss my friend DK terribly, have burned 1/2 of my LOLA candle (that is ten bucks, folks), didn't do the work I was supposed to do tonight (self-imposed masochism), I started thinking about Sparky and got really sad, the weather sucks, it may snow/ice on V-day (and V gives me  the  best V-days ever!), talked to my beautiful Vicente and he is way sick, whoo just checked my bank account balance, want implants but cannot find any venture capitalists to fund, need a haircut, have seven books and 17 magazines to read, ran out of vodka and/or champagne.

"Okay, I was talking about this with Jessica the other night, and I guess I should share this experience with people, maybe as an example, maybe as a moral.  Just something to learn from, when you're dealing with people.  I probably won't say as much here as I did to Jess, but you can get the jist of it I think.  First of all, I suppose I should say who Hannah is.  She was a (pretty much) life-long of Reena's, that I met a while into my relationship with Reena.  She was always kind, gentle, and caring, but she was horribly shy.  She was into some of the same music I was, that's the one thread we all shared, and through that I began to know her and relate to her, though it was difficult to reach through that shell of hers.  When I did though we really got to know each other, it wasn't a boyfriend/girfriend thing, but she did have a certain afection for me.  She thought it was really cool that I'm with a metal band and came to all of our shows (that she could).  She looked up to me as a role model, I think.  But she picked up a very bad bit of me, and it affected the rest of her life.  She knew of the one time I had cut myself and though I never did anything that I thought would encourage it, she picked that up from me.  She did it to herself much worse than I did, though.  She cut herself right to the bone, and ended up in the hospital.  Afterwards they took her away for her to get ""help"", though she came back even more scarred, physically and mentally.  That devestated her, and it really devestated me, because whether I meant to or not, whether I meant for that to happen or not, I had a card to play in that outcome, and the card I played was a very negative one.  The thing I learned from this, the hard way, was that when you are a part of the community or in the spotlight as I was for her, you have to be very careful about what you portray to people, you have to be conscious of that and how it may affect people, for as I learned, people can pick up negative things.  Just remember that they can pick up equally strong positive things if that's what you put your heart into showing to the world, that part of you.  Hannah and I do have a happy ending of sorts though - she's gotten over that as much as she can, and more importantly, on Tuesday she came right out and said she had forgiven me, and moreso, herself.  Now she's become what I HAD wanted for her - that same gentle, kind, and compassionate person, minus the shyness that was a barrier for her to show that to the world.  And perhaps it could be said that she gained a new insight into my own soul, going through that, and to the many others like me, and she can help them how they need to be helped."	m
"""It's been a long time. I shouldna left you without a dope beat to step to...""   so here... Recently over cranritas with Homeboy at my favorite bar ElMyr to subject of demeanorsandsuch arose. KitKat: ""You're a bitch"". Now, I'm used to hearing this  have come to accept it to some degree. I don't mind really. Love me or leave me, fah real. So this post is  DEDICATED TO MY FELLOW SO-CALLED BITCHES . ""Fuck em grrl, fuck em, fuck em grrl, fuck em"" Cause see I figured it out. People scared. Scared to be themselves, scared they ain't enuf, and they scared to want to be more like us. I know cause I used to be scared too. Then I was like, ""why?"" See I'm committed to honesty, for myself and the world. Cause I been misunderstood --guess god ain't listenin to that prayer from no Ninas--tryin to be nice. Then I get trapped into false representations when I'm really like ""Hell naw, that shit wasn't aight. Gimme my shit back!"" Ya dig? So several new year's eves ago I was I figured that out that nice shit was way back. I mean, I'm southern but not a southern sidewalk, that hospitality only goes as far as my nerves will permit.   And for what? Futhermore, what is a bitch? It's become a very subjective term. mY bitchDome can be broken down in a short list of adjectives: audacious, brave, bold, dauntless  raw. And for those who know and love/hate me, I am divine + feminine = a DiVa! Stylin fine oh so divine...  diva: Italian, literally, goddess, from Latin, feminine of divus divine, god -- DEITY  I was born and raised this way, unabashedly might I add. Seems the general consensus is that being a bitch is something to be ashamed of or apologize for. That all depends on the totality of the individual. I can safely say I'm a sensitive bitch, caring and considerate of others BUT not at the cost of my conscience or consciousness. Fuck em grrl, at the end of the day it's all about truth.

"This post refers to the June 30th show which makes it very late indeed, but the events spoken about on that program refer back to Election 2000 so what’s a week or two more when we’re speaking about events that happened four years ago in the first place?   A caller--speaking of    urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11   --brought up John Ellis (Bush cousin who called the 2000 Election for Bush for Fox News). In chastising the caller for caring about this conflict of interest, Honsberger said that the Voter News Service (VNS) projects the winner of the election; that exit polls do not enter into VNS' calculations for predicting early calls; and that Ellis's call of a Bush victory made no difference in the election outcome.  Let's take a closer look at Honsberger's pronouncements:  First, as can be seen in the  urlLink testimony given by Ted C. Savaglio, Executive Director, Voter News Service  to The Committee on Energy and Commerce in The U. S. House of Representatives on February 14, 2001 VNS  DOES  use polling as part of their projection process:   ""In addition to providing information to analyze election results, on Election Night VNS projects the outcome of contests to its members and subscribers. VNS' projections are based on complex statistical analyses that take many factors into account including, among other things: the actual vote in sample precincts, tabulated vote at the county level, and the exit poll. All of this data is reviewed and interpreted by VNS analysts who add their own knowledge and experience before making a decision that it is possible to project the outcome in a given race. Projections are made by people - not by computers.""  So Fred Honsberger is either ignorant of the process here or disseminating disinformation.  Honsberger said that there was no conflict of interest in Fox News having John Ellis functioning in this position, but as reported on CNN, Ellis's other election night activities that evening lay well outside his job description,  urlLink  “He apparently spent the evening in constant phone contact with Florida governor Jeb Bush and George W. Bush, transmitting updated exit poll numbers and projections down to Austin.”   It was certainly reported at the time that the Bushes were confident that their numbers showed they would win Florida—did they convey this to Ellis at the time he was in constant phone contact with them and did this in any way reflect on his call of the election?  Even Fox anchor Brit Hume was less than confident about projecting Bush as the winner that night when he said,  urlLink  ""I must tell you, everybody, after all this, all night long, we put Bush at 271, Gore at 243. I feel a little bit apprehensive about the whole thing. I have no reason to doubt our decision desk, but there it is.""   Now to the important question as to whether or not the projection of Bush as the winner by Fox News made any difference in the eventual outcome of the election, urlLink  lets all take a step back in time and recall how the events unfolded that night:      With information provided from the Voter News Service, NBC was the first network to project Gore the winner in Florida at 7:48 pm.  At 7:50 pm, CNN and CBS project Gore the winner in Florida as well.” By 8:02 pm, all five networks and the Associated Press had called Gore the winner in Florida. Even the VNS called Gore the winner at 7:52 pm. At 2:16 am, Fox calls Florida for Bush, NBC follows at 2:16 am. ABC is the last network to call the Florida for Bush, at 2:20 am, while AP and VNS never call Florida for Bush.   Ten minutes after the top of the hour, network excitement was again beginning to build. At 2:16 a.m., the call was made: Fox News Channel, with Bush's first cousin John Ellis running its election desk, was the first to project Florida -- and the presidency -- for the Texas governor. Within minutes, the other networks followed suit. ""George Bush, Governor of Texas will become the 43rd President of the United States,"" CNN's Bernard Shaw announced atop a graphic montage of a smiling Bush. ""At 18 minutes past two o'clock Eastern time, CNN declares that George Walker Bush has won Florida's 25 electoral votes and this should put him over the top.""   In other words, even by 2 am, no other network felt confident enough to call the election for Bush or Gore even though VNS had projected Gore winning Florida hours before. It was Fox News, under the direction of John Ellis, who first splattered the airwaves with ‘Bush Wins’ patriotic graphics that goaded the other networks to follow suit because—after all—we all know that the networks are in a race to declare the winner on election night. The public was left with the indelible imagery of ‘Bush Wins’ on that night and it was an uphill battle for Gore from then on.  Fox continued to amplify this message by a constant barrage of daily ‘Sore Loserman’ references on their ‘Fox and Friends’ morning show.    But after everything that has come out about this mess of an election, Honsberger would still have you believe that VNS called Florida for Bush; that VNS makes purely objective calls based solely on precinct returns; and that the other networks are in no way influenced when one of their brethren makes a pronouncement on the winner.  Bullshit or perhaps that should be Bushit.   * * *   In more recent news, here’s another story that we don’t expect the Honz to report on:   On July 8th, the Congress voted on an amendment to Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act to prevent the government from using this section of the act to go to the federal secret court to get an order requiring the disclosure of Americans' reading records.  After the 17 minute time limit expired the amendment had won 219-201 (with almost 30 Republicans voting for the amendment). But this wasn’t the outcome that Bush wanted so the Republicans kept the voting open twice as long as scheduled and twisted a few arms until they got a tie vote of 210-210 (which defeated the amendment).  The shouts of ‘Shame’ by the Democrats rising to their feet did not dissuade the Republicans from this outrageous overturning of voting because, as we know, the Republicans have a history of overturning elections. I guess if that tactic hadn’t worked they could have simply had the Homeland Security Office announce that the voting would have to be suspended due to terrorist concerns—but wait—they may be saving that trick for November."	m
ok, so my mom and i had a pretty good conversation tonight, after she brought cayle home.....cayle, who was too sick to go trick-or-treating........who started in moaning on the coach when asked to start her homework....she who had been quiet all day until homeowrk was brought up...............anyway, my mom and i got to talking about the florida right-to-die case that republican jeb bush has 'championed'.........my mother, who is a life-long republican, is totally against the re-instatement of the tube in this woman who has been in a vegetative state for 13 years.....'your father would have been horrified if i had insisted on a tube',.......she recalled......yes, he would have been.....and though it was pitiful to watch him slowly starve to death (nov 18, 2002) it was much better than to watch him linger for years..........none of this playing god business.....it would have been playing god to put a tube in, not the other way around..............to our family, we let him go to his maker in a serene, positive way....not grasping for life that was no longer there..............hard to believe that a whole year has passed..........	f

Me and ""TJ"" went to help Ms. Jordan to change her file things.  She gave us Twizzlers for helping her. Yum Yum.  So we went back to Mrs. Laster's class and Ms. Gladwell came in and Anisa asked her if some of us could go to tanagrams so Mrs. Laster picked ppl and I wasn't one of them so I just got up and left. HeHeHe. Then after that we went back to her class and Jordan Wilson was outside and he was hilarious! He would come in there and like sneak around and get her all mad it was really funny!! Then we went back to homeroom with all the ppl who didn't make the ar celebration and who was still waiting to go.

Right then.   Last night was excellent. The Party on the Plaza. Except it wasn't on the Plaza because it was pissing down.  So instead it was the party in the Senior Dining Room. I had to go up and help them shift the tables around.  Of course come six o'clock the sun came out and it would have been a perfect evening for it.  Right so two pints of Stella at lunch time. One pint in the Quad before I went up to the party and then inumerable bottles of beer  (IT WAS FREE!!!!)  Well until that ran out (hadn't eating anything all day either) then had to go on the punch which was fucking lethal.  Then Alan bought some champagne so that also went into the punch....  Yep I was more than little hammered. Of course I wasn't the only who was.  Matt collected all the balloons and decided that he was going to try and fly. So he's got maybe a hundred balloons and he's up on the table determined to try and jump off and fly (can't wait 'till we get the photos of that back)  At one point we got the Stewards radios and Chris and I are singing together from different parts of the room. I got some funny looks when I went to toilet and I'm reporting my progress on the radio.  Went to the George after that. Had a pint and then decided to go.  So I did.  Made it to the Arms for one. Don't know how though. I was absolutely wasted. Now I can get hammered but I've rarely been that drunk. I barely made it onto the train at Seven Sisters...and for that matter why the hell didn't I go from Liverpool Street.  I remember sitting on the bench at Seven Sisters and having to use all of my mental effort to get up and walk onto the train. Fucking world had decided to go all slanty on me.  I mean what the hell's all that about?  What I ever do to it?  It was a good night.  Oh and here's to Kate and Chris on their one year anniversary. Rock on guys     urlLink Email me you spanners!	f
[Current Music - Steve Vai  Ry Cooder - The Duel From Crossroads]   Today is too hot, far too hot.

Thanks to Kevin Davis (unofficial organizer who ran the entire event from what I can tell) and company a great time was had in Vancouver this weekend playing Ultimate in a 24-hour charity event for Alzheimer's.  Have to admit I only made it through 12-hours, but it was a fantastic 12-hours.  A small frickets tournament was setup to accompany the Ultimate.  First time I have played this wonderful little game and am already hooked.  Only had a chance to play it once, but am dying to give it another go.  Other 'big news' at the tournament was this new fangled  urlLink Penta Water .  Apparently this stuff is treated with high energy sound waves to break down the length of the H2O molecules so your body can absorb it faster.

Well off to the job once again.  Today I get to take a special visit to Ford.  For those of you who don't understand what exactly it is I do.  My job is really quite simple.  I take a model of a part on a computer, open it up, save it as a different format, FTP it to a UNIX computer, open it up, re-constrain it (basically put all the screws and joints back into in the part), save it as yet another format, FTP it back to a Windows machine, and then transfer it to Ford.  Doesn't sound to difficult does it?  Well Ford seems to be having problems opening the work I've been doing for the last 6 weeks.  I tried to tell them they should be checking files from day 1.  Now I'm over 80% done with the entire project, ahead of schedule I might add, and they hit problems.  Well technically to give them the benefit of the doubt, I got the first call at just beyond the 50% mark, but still.  I tried opening the files on our end; reversing the process.  Worked fine.  I tried to phone them how to open them as I did to get a working model.  They couldn't get it to work.  They stop calling me with problems for a week.  I continue on, get another 30% done, then they e-mail me, and say they still haven't gotten anything to work and that we should fix it.  Now I normally wouldn't have a problem with this.  But basically what they are doing here is saying that we should do their end for them, I'd do that, if they were paying me to do so.    There is an intern on the other end, basically the only guy there I'm dealing with.  His name is Shannon, which I find odd, because I thought I was talking to a female before he called me up.  So based on Ford's incompetence to finish my project, and my great desire to get it done, I'm going to take the helm at today's meeting, all by myself.  I'm going over there to sit at a table with 10 guys from Ford, by myself.  I'm marching into enemy territory armed only with my knowledge of the project, and the vast feeling I'm being suckered into doing more work than I really need to.  I've came to one conclusion.  People who work at Ford must have to force themselves to have problems so that they can say that their job is warrented and they don't need to be eliminated.  When I took over the project the guy before me had only 1 guy on the other end of the phone.  If there ever was a problem, he'd just fix it on his own.  Unfortunately, he only ran through one test case that worked flawlessly with Shannon, and now their process is jumbled.  On the bright side, I get to be the superhero I always wanted to be!	m

"So, my nephew, D, spent the night. Well the last two nights. He went to work with me at the store today. I split my shift with the new punk-rock girl. She needed more hours and I hate to work. I used 4 hours sick pay. He, D, had fun at my work. We did the photo lab and when it was really boring, he just played on the internet. He is seven and can pretty much entertain himself. Thank God.   Scary, nickname for my husband, just got this new PS2 game, NBA Ballers. He has been playing it non-stop. I used to like video games, but now it is use the analog for this and the trigger for that. Push A twice if you want this. It wasn't fun anymore, so I don't really play much.   Scary also brought home that movie ""Butterfly Effect"" last night. So here is my first movie review.... I liked the concept very well. I have the same notion that one slightly different move may alter the future forever. I was expecting Ashton Kutcher to be stupid, like that 70's show, but he was ok. Not anything special really. I was overall satisfied with the movie, just on the premise alone. We did not know that on the other side of the disc (the theatrical cut) that there were two alternate endings. I would like to see that too.   I get vacation time in January. I haven't had a real vacation since last May. May a year ago May. So I really want to go somewhere. I decided I liked cruises after the Alaska cruise. The idea that you get to travel to all these different cities while still chilling at the hotel is cool. I want to go somewhere warm on a cruise next time though. I want to hang out by the pool and on my balcony. I also want to go to Fiji sometime. Add to the list... Australia, South Africa (of course), Ireland, Amsterdam, London, Italy, Rome... I guess we could just do a European cruise. I think that is a 14 day cruise though. I only get a week vacation. Oh well.   Since I work at a photo lab, I am finally getting some of my pictures put on a disk so I can add them here. I am a procrastinater and it will be awhile though.  I want to take a short trip to Dallas, to visit my brother and his woman. They just bought a house and I have not been to see him EVER since he has lived in Dallas. The catch to this is... I want to just go with my mom and leave Scary here. He won't go for this, I bet. We'll see."	f
"this entry brought to you by  the strokes, ""last nite""  note: this was originally written back in january, the day after the state of the union address. due to scribble's performance, I couldn't post it until february, and immediately afterward scribble went down for good. in order to afford you the chance to read it, I offer it again. If you're new to my page and don't know anything about Bushwhacker, well, it's not difficult to get the gist, now is it?       Good evening, my fellow Americans of America. This is The Diabolical Bushwhacker, aka The Big Dub, aka Ferrari.   Tonight, as I address the address on the state of the union, some of you might be asking yourselves, ""Why 'Ferrari'? Why would he randomly choose the nickname 'Ferrari' for himself, and then mention it as if we were already referring to him as 'Ferrari'?"" Well, I was listening to that funky-fresh song ""Wanksta"" by 50 Cent, and I figured, if he can do it, then surely I, the All Powerful Bushwhacker, can get in on a deal like that. But you know, I'm still The Bushwhacker to my homies. Don't be fooled by these Constitution-shredding Acts that I got. I'm still Dubya From The Block.  Anyway, let Ferrari get back to the point he needs to make right  heesy  about this  addressizzle .  Firstly, how do you all like that 20  billion  I'm planning on pulling out of already spiraling deficit for a mission to Mars that probably won't ever go anywhere concrete? It's probably resting  real easy  after that  87  billion  I asked Congress for to continue the  Wizzar  in Iraq that nobody in particular asked for. Didn't see  that  one coming, did you? Of course you didn't. Didn't mean it  stung  any less of course, but at least you you know that with this administration, every time my face shows up on the  telly , I'm probably going to be talking about billions upon billions of dollars I plan on spending needlessly. See? Being a Supervillain of Supervillianry proportions like ol' Ferrari doesn't mean you have to expect  devastating ,  crushing  blows, one right after another. Sometimes I like to soften the blow a little  softer  by letting you see it coming a mile away.  But let me make a definite point here. Even when you're  the  Supervillain Extraordinare, 20  billion -- with a b!-- plus 87  billion  from a couple months ago isn't that easy to come by. Where the hell is all that money going to come from, you might be  axing  yourself. The answer, of course, is in giant tax hikes for the middle class-- what did you expect?  However, I'm here to tell you today, it's not  just  about those crippling, yet predictable tax hikes. There are alternatives to milking your taxmonies dry to oil the well-funded pockets of the Military Machine and the people that profit from it. After much brainstorming, my administration has come up with a way to help fund the never-ending bloodshed in The Evil Part of the World, as  well as  stupid, superficial space plans that won't benefit anyone.  And so, I present to you...     THE JUICEWHACKER!  That's right. The Bushwhacker is going to sell to  you  the ultimate in juicing technology, The Juicewhacker. With its three settings-- ""Juice"", ""Juicier"", and  ""Juiciest"" , it'll turn any household vegetable, fruit, or mineral that you can buy at the grocery store into the most delicious,  natural  drink money can buy.   How much would you have to pay for a tall, cool glass of 100% orange juice from the grocery store? 75 dollars? 80? Folks, for the fancy,  designer  brand orange juice in your grocer's refringerated section, you could be paying  100 dollars , all for a gallon of juice. For one gallon!  Not with the JUICEWHACKER! All it takes is a handful of any combination of natural produce to create a tall, cool, refreshing glass of your favorite juice substance.  ""But Bushwhacker!"" I hear you saying. ""How do I know this patented technology works?""  Well, you don't have to take  my  word for it! Just look at the few lucky troops in the Middle East that aren't part of an ever-expanding, depressing heap of dead. They're required at least three glasses of juice from the JUICEWHACKER a day. It helps keep them energized, revitalized, with high morale, ready to take on Evil Doers day in and day out.  All you have to do is look at our results ! Just yesterday, we opened up one new school!! A new school! A school where they'll learn of The Great Bushwhacker, the Villain Who Saved Them From a Slightly Worse Villain, and will grow to love Americans and McDonald's French Fries and Mom's  apple pie ! I mean, you can't argue with that kind of hard evidence! At least, not until it gets blown up by ""friendly fire"" or a terrorist or something.  How much would  you  pay for a wonderful, blessed-by-Jesus-himself juice-makin' machine like this? 86.7  billion dollars ?  You can get this  revolutionary  machine ordered  directly to your door  for the low, low price of 71 monthly installments of $3,738! If you drink only 60 glasses of juice per day, in just  forty years  it'll pay for itself! Think of the savings!   Listen folks, you might want to order this Juicewhacker. Not only is it patented and  Juice-a-licious , we're going to get the money from you whether it be  very slowly  from your paychecks, or through the 71 monthly installments. And this way, you get a handy-dandy juice machine instead of just a feeling that you've just been  violated . And not the  good  kind of violation, either!  Good evening, and God bless. Respect to my homie Ash-C. Peace out.  END COMMUNICATION. -----"	m

what does it mean to be responsible? am i?  why must i hesitate to do what i am supposed to do? is it all because of my parents absence?... no... that shouldn't be. i have my life and i choose to take the choices a make. maybe it's just my romantic side, day-dreaming once again... taking up all my time and hoping for things that could never happen.   must i also take responsibility for my actions? of course! must i know what they are?... normally... however, my focus sometimes is lost and engulfed by my romantic yet dark side.... i cry for a more exciting life...   i need to keep this other side of me under control. if i don't, it will consume me and i will become the person i am not.	m
I was supposed to go out tonight with Jenny.  She was going to call me last night after 10PM and I didn't hear from her.  I tried calling for 2 hours this afternoon and the phone was busy.  Later on the phone just rang and rang.  Um, OK.  Needless to say I'm not the happiest camper right now.  I hope everything's OK at her house, and I wish she'd have called me to let me know we weren't going out tonight.  That is all.	f
"This is getting out of hand.    House Approves $447 Billion in Spending for Military By CARL HULSE  Published: May 21, 2004   ASHINGTON, May 20 - The House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a $447 billion military package that includes the extra $25 billion sought by the Bush administration to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through early next year.  Authors of the measure, which passed by a bipartisan margin of 391 to 34, said it was specifically geared toward the needs of those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing $1 billion for new vehicle armor, replenishing stockpiles of arms and ammunition and giving military personnel a pay raise and other benefits.   Advertisement     ""This is the year of the troops,"" said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  The House defied a veto threat from the administration by keeping a two-year delay on a round of military base closings set for next year, easily defeating an effort to require the closings to move forward in 2005. Mr. Hunter and other senior Republicans said they did not expect the Pentagon's spending plan for the year beginning Oct. 1 to be rejected over the base closing provision.  Senators were moving much more slowly with their own $422 billion measure and abandoned hope of finishing before leaving on their Memorial Day break. Both the House and Senate were considering the proposals against the backdrop of the prison scandal in Iraq and continuing unrest and uncertainty there.  ""We are in a war,"" said Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ""Neither the country nor this Congress was united in initiating the conflict, but we stand now as one with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines fighting it.""  House Democrats complained throughout two days of debate that they were prevented from offering important amendments, but in the end most of them supported the legislation. Some Democrats said the $400 million for body armor and other ""force protection"" provisions showed that the troops dispatched to Iraq were ill-equipped in the first place. ""There is no excuse for us to send our soldiers into harm's way without this most basic protection,"" said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York.  Among the personnel benefits in the measure are a 3.5 percent pay increase, a raise in hazardous duty and family separation pay, improved survivor benefits and elimination of a limit on the construction of military housing. The measure also allows for adding 30,000 troops in the Army over the next three years and 9,000 in the Marine Corps.  Democrats again failed to strip the measure of money for researching a new nuclear weapon capable of penetrating underground bunkers. But Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, Democrat of California, noted that the 214-to-204 vote was closer than a similar effort last year, which she read as a sign of growing skepticism about new nuclear devices. Opponents of the nuclear program say it could spur proliferation.  The most significant fight was over the plan to proceed next year with the base closings, an important matter for lawmakers trying to protect facilities in their districts. Opponents of delaying the base closings said that the military needed to get moving on shutting under-used facilities and that the economic impact on communities was exaggerated.  But supporters of the two-year delay said the makeup of the armed forces was undergoing significant changes given the conflict in Iraq and that it would be impractical to proceed next year before a study of overseas installations was finished.  ""Too many balls are in the air,"" said Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the subcommittee on military readiness. Mr. Hefley prevailed, 259 to 162, against the push to keep the closings on track. That decision sets up an eventual showdown with the Senate, which this week narrowly defeated an effort to delay the closings.  The House also gave its support to tearing down the Abu Ghraib prison, the scene of the abuse of Iraq detainees, and replacing it with a new facility. But lawmakers defeated a Democratic push for a special Congressional inquiry into the abuse as Democrats complained that the House was failing in oversight of the war.  The debate in the Senate got off track this week when the Armed Services Committee spent much of Wednesday on its third hearing into the prison abuse cases. Lawmakers will take the bill up again in about 10 days. The Senate consideration promises to be more contentious than the House, though the outcome is likely to be the same, with a wide approval for the measure.  Both parties are near agreement on incorporating the $25 billion in war money in the Senate measure. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is trying to add a requirement that President Bush deliver a report on his strategy for stabilizing Iraq. Democrats also intend to challenge the spending on new nuclear weapons and money for missile defense while proposing a troop increase beyond that adopted by the House."	m

But the record is more complicated than that, of course, especially as Dean moves from grass-roots obscurity on the Democratic left to a leading contender.

For the Last Time…   There is much talk around the water-cooler and among my friends about the upcoming elections.  Bush.  Dean.  Republican.  Democrat.  Warmonger.  Tree-hugger.  It has been my experience that people have difficulty grasping the concept that I do not label myself with any party seal.  That, coupled with the fact that I am disgusted with politics and politicians, leads me to withhold my views.  No – I do not have to choose a side.  There is no platform that, as a whole, encompasses my beliefs.    Fine.  If I must be barcoded, then label me with:    | |||| || |||| || ||| || | ||| || ||.  What?  Is that not clear?  Go ahead.  Scan it.  It will tell you only that I am a Christian, which speaks nothing of my politics – merely that I do not look left or right for answers, but up.  As November draws nearer, it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid unwelcome importunities to comment on my political affiliation.  I realize that my refusal to be baited into these heated discussions is a source of irritation for some of my friends and coworkers.  Yeah, well…Get over it.  The fact is, that while I enjoy listening to the largely outraged opinions of those around me, I prefer to remain private about my own.  Do not fret over my silence and occasional murmurs of accord – or was that protest? - But sleep well in knowing that you are right and always will be.  Yes, you too.  And you.  And you, as well.   Clear as mud?	f

Whenever someone leaves the firm, they send a Departure memo to everyone in the office, thanking people who they've worked with, providing contact information, etc.  But why save them just for when you're leaving for good?   TO: All Personnel RE: Goodbye (for the day)   I am leaving the office at 5:30 today, with great sadness, for an opportunity to spend some extended time with my family until returning tomorrow morning.  Before I leave, I would like to thank a number of people for helping to make my time in the office today pleasant and rewarding: thanks to Bob for the guidance and support, John for taking me out to lunch, Sheila for holding the elevator for me, and Herb for cleaning the office.  Thanks to Joe for making sure the photocopier did not run out of paper; thanks to Lauren for all of the good times; thanks to James for helping me through the rough spot around 2:00 when I couldn't find my keys.  It would be impossible for me to recall everyone I've worked with today, but I hope you all know how much I've appreciated the opportunity and chance to continue my legal career with such wonderful people.  I will miss you all, during my commute home, as well as when I get there, and I will keep you all in mind until I return.  Please stay in touch.  You can reach me by e-mail, although probably not until after 7:00; of course my cell phone will be with me at all times.  I hope to remain in contact with all of you; you are my lighthouse in the storm.  I regret not having the chance to contribute more to the team during my time here today; if only I had taken ten more minutes to read the document this morning; if only I hadn't missed the light coming back from lunch -- the regrets are virtually endless.  But I will treasure the time I spent -- in my office, in the lobby, in the bathroom, and the many other paths I've crossed from this morning until now.  At the risk of leaving out something I will regret, I want to bring this note to an end with a wish that every job could be as fulfilling as mine has been, today, and share with you the feeling that my heart beats more strongly and my soul shines brighter because of these 8 hours we've spent together.  Do not hesitate to let me know if there is ever anything I can do for you, at least until the morning.  Also note that I will be unavailable this evening between 7 and 7:20 due to an appointment for a haircut.  Callers during that time will be able to leave a voice mail, and I will return those messages as soon as I am able.  This brief vacation from electronic communication will allow my spirits to rejuvenate before taking on the next set of challenges that my life has to offer.  Cheers, and Best Wishes, Jeremy	m

"As I sit here @ my computer I wonder about a lot of things. Why summer goes by soo fast.....Why do I always waste the little amount of summer I have.....and why doesn't anyone appreciate what that time means. I guess It's cuz we just get caught up in the moment. We don't ever think about the future because we expect to ""cross that bridge when we get to it"". But, everybody doesn't just get that future. Things happen and unfortunately ppl have to die before their time. My pastor told me that everyday is a good day no matter what happens to you, because you were able to wake up and live life that many others could not have. I don't know very much. I'm only 15 short years old, and yet I feel I am cursed with the sorrow of endless ages of war, evil and injustice. I wanna lay back and just be a normal teen....go to parties,be crazy....drink....and live by the seat of my pants. But, Something is telling me to be different, to dream of scientific providence...to dream of Jesus's return..to build toward a heaven we could all grasp. I take a moment's rest and step back from all of this philosophy and prophecy and I think of what I could have done. I could have been a jock....with no brains but natural athletic talent to spare. Maybe a suave devonair pimp with beautiful women hanging from my shoulders and popularity beyond dreams of chess geeks. I could have been a science geek with a 4.5 gpa and a college degree at age 12 but in the end i am and will always be the guy that tried to clone himself (W/O HIS MOTHERS TAMPON OR SEMEN). I guess science like this is what i will do when i finish college. I hope i am the first person to completely clone myself and i hope i go in the record books. In fact i hope i am the first scientist to successfully alter genes and create a super human. Look for me on the news in the next 20 years you might be able to say you once new that guy....the guy that changed science forever."	m

"BY KNUT ROYCE WASHINGTON BUREAU  August 3, 2004  WASHINGTON --  More financial institutions than previously disclosed may be at risk of attack, and an al-Qaida operative has told British intelligence that the group's target date is early September, intelligence sources said yesterday.  The operative, described as ""credible"" by British intelligence, told his debriefers that the attack would take place ""60 days before the presidential election"" on Nov. 2, according to a former senior National Security Council official. On Sept. 2 President George W. Bush is expected to address the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden.  Counterterrorism officials are analyzing data from a computer seized in Pakistan last month to see if financial institutions in addition to the five disclosed Sunday are at risk of attack, U.S. officials said yesterday.  The former senior National Security Council official said he was told by British intelligence that they are interrogating an al-Qaida operative who confirmed that financial institutions are being targeted and that an attack was planned for September.  And a U.S. official familiar with the ongoing analysis of the computer said, ""There are references to other things [buildings]"" in the al-Qaida computer's data, including a picture of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. ""There is mention of other places.""  The laptop computer was seized on July 25 following the arrest after a 12-hour gun battle of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who is wanted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.  Pakistan's information minister confirmed to The Associated Press yesterday that e-mail data retrieved from Ghailani's computer indicated planned attacks in both the United States and Britain. A British official said that the threat to the U.K. was not specific.  -- Hold onto your party hats kids...it's going to be a bumpy ride.   Andrew B."	m

"So I have been a beach lover all my life. Despite the rather excruciating pain in my tooth, I was game for a day at the beach. Knowing K and his (sometimes irritating) eye to detail we got all packed and all for a casual day at the beach with his friend. And what happens? It rains on our parade!  We left late. Ok, my fault. But I do happen to think that speaking with my mom is marginally more important. And when we finally reached we had a rather long drive to the beach. Getting down from the car, I nearly froze my a** off but K and his friend decided we should go for a walk. Not a bad idea but it was so windy, and after walking for what felt like miles against the wind, I felt like calling it a day. So we get in the car again. Going to lunch, my travel sickness decided to put in an appearance, so I spent half the journey on my cellphone talking with my friend, with my head between my knees, so as to distract myself from the rather ""uprising"" sensation in my throat.  Lunch was a grand affair and one of the highlights I considered for the day. After that scrumptious experience (despite the tooth), we decided to go to the friend's place, during which time I blissfully took a short nap.  Blah blah blah, the rest of the day was uneventful. oh I should mention for dessert what I had was a cake, warm from the oven with rich chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream on top. That truly was the main event of the day. The sea was a washout. The journey to and fro was nice and comfy with me and my babe, not squabbling for a change but nice and snuggly instead. comme ci, comme ca. That's what the day was like..."	f
"Whenever we have a summer associate event in the evenings, people who live outside of Manhattan can get a car back.

So I was talking to my mom on my cell phone while in the car, and I mentioned something about a bunch of other summer associates mentioning to me tonight that they had seen my weblog, and after I hung up, the car driver starts a conversation with me.  I swear all of this is real.  I swear.  ""You a summer associate?"" ""Yeah."" ""Good thing you don't work for [firm].  They find out someone has something like a weblog, they fire you instantly.  Not tomorrow, not next week, today."" ""Oh."" ""But the firm you should really go work for is [other firm].  Nicest people in New York.  We drive for all of the firms.  [Your firm] is fine, but [other firm] is the best.  Everyone is very polite, very nice to each other, and don't just get in the car and start yelling at people over their phones.  You should work for [other firm].  Very liberal.  Very nice people."" ""Oh."" ""What kind of law you want to do?"" ""[kind of law]"" ""Oh.  Yes.  [Other firm] is great at that.  Do you know [partner at other firm who by coincidence happened to be one of the people at that firm who interviewed me]?"" ""Yeah.  Big guy, right?"" ""Yes.  And one of the best lawyers in New York.  You want to do [kind of law], [other firm] is where you should be.  [This partner]'s wife, a very old woman, is so bossy.  They were late to a hockey game, and she goes on and on and on.

I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed. Be confident in the knowledge you already have; we've all been preparing for this since the first day we signed up for AP -- just do you best. For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over!  Kailie	f

"FUCKING PEOPLE!!!   So I have this ""co-worker"", we'll call him  That Fucking Asshole Cocksucking Dickhead (Not to Mention Ashamed Closet Homosexual) Dave  for Short. I put co-worker in quotes because, well, he's not actually a co-worker as he's not an employee of the company. He's one of our contract workers currently acting as our ""Analytical Chemist."" I put Analytical Chemist in quotes because the fucking moron doesn't know dick about analytical chemistry (yet, he has a PhD in the subject which just goes to show you that the value of an education can be equivalent to a ""Hot Cup of Jack Squat!"" at times)!  My disgust at this poor excuse for an employee can be traced back to his entrance into my company but I'll start you a little later than that...   This past spring, the company that I am currently employed with was going through some financial problems and as such I was made to lay off all of the contract people under myself. Now this fucking sucked! Sure a couple of them needed to go as they weren't working out very well, but I also had to lay off a few people that were quality workers, some of whom I had become friends with. So all contractors are gone... but not Dave (nor myself, as I was contract at the time, but I actually do work dammit... granted, I'm blogging right now but...  Fuck You for Judging Me! )  Anyway, the next step was to staff all of our operation necessities internally. So the deal was that I relegated myself and Dave to the night shift as  everyone  else in the company had seniority over the two of us. Now, during the two weeks we were together on nights, I had been having a conflict with another co-worker over some procedural issues that aren't worth getting into. Dave takes it upon himself to talk with me about how I should be gentler in the handling of the situation so as not to cause strife within the company. ""For the Good of the Company"" is his reasoning.  A week later he tells to our boss he can't work nights anymore because it conflicts with his personal schedule...  FUCKING DICK!  He fucking gets away with it too! I would have said, ""You can't work nights... bye."" When you're on contract you can't make demands like that (at least you shouldn't be able to). I know, because I've been layed off as a contractor before. Your job is never secure so you take what you can get. Arrgghh!  Also, Dave is single (and a suspected closet-queer) and has no life that I can discern except he stays her on Fridays until midnight sometimes to work on his motorcycle. I, on the other hand, am married and have friends that like to go out for drinks during the week after work... and his social life is affected?  So, because of his refusal to work, we hire one of our former contract employees back. Now, I am glad we did, because he's a good worker and a friend. But the point is, Dave, a bastard who, less than a week earlier was talking to me about what's ""Good for the Company,"" is now costing the company more money by refusing to work a night shift! Fucking hypocritical dick (did I mention he's a devout Christian, maybe that's where the hypocrisy came from).  So flash forward to tonight (ignoring all of the other shit: milking the company for overtime every week, spending our money on shit he doesn't need just to look like he's doing something, doing  nothing  most of the time he's at work but talking to vendors all day, etc.). I had sent out an e-mail that stated that we would be stripping and waxing the floors for all of the offices in the lab (where Dave's, as well as mine, are located). He comes back with the following response:   While I appreciate your cleaning and waxing the floors ....  Since this is affecting the work of others, wouldn't it make sense to check with them to see if it is OK before planning to do it ?   While this is a ""down"" week on the schedule for the reactors, I have plenty of work to do involving the lab and my office.  I don't want to empty out my office completely just to have the floors done.   I'd rather leave the floor as is or just do the ""traffic areas"".  If this is going to take 2 days to do and will tie up the lab and control room, could it be done on a weekend so as not to disturb the work of others.   You know what...  fuck you . This is something that needs to be done, and this is a good time to do it because it's right before New Year's vacation which will give the wax time to dry after it's applied. And the other thing is, if I asked everyone when would be a good time, it would never get done. And The Other Thing Is, you don't get to decide if your office needs waxing or not because, as you are not an employee, you do not have to deal with the long-term consequences. AND THE OTHER THING IS, if you're so keen for weekend work, maybe you should do your shit over the weekend.  AND THE OTHER THING IS, YOU DON'T FUCKING DO ANY WORK HERE ANYWAY!!!   The main thing that pisses me of is it all comes down to Dave looking out for his hours. That's the truth of the matter. He just wants hours to guarantee he gets paid. Well, other contractors aren't guaranteed shit, and he shouldn't be either. You know, it would piss me off so much that he's just looking out for number one, if he didn't try to manufacture the appearance that he gives a shit about anything else. I have no conclusion to this story at the moment so I will simply grumble as I shuffle off begrudgingly."	m

It has now been officially one month since my last cigarette.  The “Heatwave Glimpse” I did for today’s Sunday Service got completed and went over well at both services.”  I am roughly at about 70% done with reviewing and cataloging all the footage I took at Heatwave which means the capturing/editing portion will go much smoother.  Overall, progress towards completion is further than expected.  I’ve picked up a second job at Ward Construction.  Things are going well and I’m hoping that this will become a full time job (that I enjoy…) in which I work mornings and get evenings and weekends off.  That would be beautiful.	m

There is not one thing more irritating than having to tell perpetually stupid people the same thing over and over.  The children next door are two of the most abnoxious, ignorant, under-supervised products of random imbreeding I have ever met.  So far CPS has been called out to their house 9 or 10 times (not by me.)  I am wondering how these awful parents, whom let their daughter ( I am guessing she is in between 6-8 years old) Swing a metal snow shovel around my trailor windows and car. And allow their 4-5 year old to play in the street, and ride the bike alone.  They throw things at my house, they scream for help like someone is kidnapping them, and when you go to check on them, nothing is wrong except the can't tie their shoe.  Parents who allow this kind of shit to happen are hideous!  If you can't handle the responsibility of children, give them to some who can!  ~Tiffany	f

current music:  Interpol 'turn on the bright lights' its been a while ok!  I fear something horrible is happening..........   I may be losing my love of music.   ...Along with my sex drive, my lou reed tshirt, and my mind.   CURSE THIS MEDICATION!   Anyways, I don't think I'm actually LOSING my love for music but more that I look at it in such a different way now. Obviously I should have known this would happen undertaking a music BUSINESS course and all. I never thought I would become so business minded! Even the people in my class still OBSESS over new bands and stuff, but now, when I hear a new band or a new song, my immediate reaction is: What do they look like? How can I market this? What should the video treatment be? Regional tour, national tour, sponsorship, stylists, management, contracts, promoters, booking agents, producers, labels blah blah blah blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH!  Its horrible! I've lost all my music listening innocence!  I guess its not that bad, I actually quite enjoy it. Lucky I'm not a musician then it would be ten times worse!    PS - Laurie!

Why is everything always falling down on me? I try so hard to make everything work out and just when I think my life is perfect, BAM!! I hit a fucking brick wall and everything is shattered into a million, jagged, pieces. Then, when I try to pick the pieces up, I cut my hands and just end up drowning in a pool of my blood and I have no one to blame except myself. I wish that just once, my life wouldn't be a fucked-up mess! I thought I found happiness. I thought that I would no longer be this angry little Goth who hates everything unless it will destroy her. I thought I had a reason to wake-up in the morning. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have nothing, NOTHING!! And I believe in nothing! I AM NOTHING! I just wanted to be happy and this is what a get. I can't even lay down because of all the fucking knives that are in my back! I wish that, just for once, instead of me bleeding for everyone else, I wish someonewould bleed for me. No one has ever bled for me. I passed out last night, for some odd reason,and I woke up with the most fucked-up headache and no one cares. I don't even care. I have no purpose in my life except to destroy myself. I don't even have to do it because everyone else is doing a great job destroying me. I have suffered for so long and I don't see an end. Someone, anyone, please hear my cry and if you know me, or even if you don't know me, if you care, then let me know because I feel so alone right now.	f
I couldn't really think of anything whitty to put as the title for this one. I tried, but it just didn't work. So where did track 14 come from? It's the last song on the Black Album and it is stuck in my head due to the haunting rift on it-very blues-I need to find out who recorded that song that they got it from. We've been slammed all day, I know we should be, because it is Friday, but due to the fact that last Friday was before a holiday weekend, odds are we should have been this slammed last week. Anyway, I am working all weekend, which isn't too great, but it is what it is and I am sure I will get some things caught up and some things cleaned up around here.  So I got to listen to the Gray Album by Danger Mouse yesterday and it is great. My brother is going to burn me a copy and I will let you all hear it. Don't start rolling your eyes about how you hate rap or hate the Beatles, etc., just listen to it, you will be surprised. I am sure that once MJ and Jay Z's teams hear this things they will cut some deal and put it back on the shelves-it would sell rather well.  I did have a married woman come on to me today and I was flattered, but at the same time, I do have some kind of principles. Not to say her advances were blunt, but it was obvious what her point was. Very pretty for her age, but again-no dice-not the right thing to do. Is it hard to find some single women in my age bracket to have a no commitment relationship with? Dates, sex, etc, but not be totally exclusive or very serious? I seem to be very popular with the women 35 and up or the 20 something divorcees with kid(s), but you can't tell me there aren't some 24-30 year olds that are single? And family wonders why I don't settle down-shit!  Well, I think the no drinking, combined with the work out and diet is working. I am not really dropping pounds-just 3 or 4, but I can tell the difference in the mirror, a little more tone, muscles looks bigger, etc. I think I am going to take some Polaroids and then do it again in a month and compare the differences. I really do want to get into shape for the beach, then again, who doesn't.  Hope everyone has a great weekend. Tonight I am going to chill at my place.

Remember the last time when I quickly put to rest the idea of time travel? Well, I'm at it again with the very simple logic that makes you stop and say...dang.  Homosexuals like to complain. It's really that simple. They love to complain about how they are denied their rights because they aren't allowed to marry. What they need to realize is that they have the exact same rights as everyone else. They can marry someone of the opposite sex, just like heterosexuals. We all have that exact same right. And yeah, it's really that simple.	m

Well only 10 more days left till graduation.  Then no more high school.  I will be missing the place but I got to move on.

(if there is no draft :-X) We will just have to wait and see, that's all.  Today was rather crappy.  We did nothing in gym but sat outside because of the temperature...

"To J - hey dude. You bring up a point that applies to me too. I want to express great thoughts in class, but i seem to only regurgitate what other critics have said. Even if I read and read all the time, I seem to become less intelligent; no new thoughts. But, I figure that as long as I feel something, I exist. ""I feel; therefore, I am,"" says LaChelle. Feeling is very important. I have read studies where people who have amygdala damage in their brains make bad choices because even though they can still figure out logically what the better choice is, they don't choose it all the time because of their inability to recognize what the consequences of that decision might feel like. So YAY for JAY!  I now have a thesis for my paper. I now have visions of resources. I shall proceedeth to OU-eth tomorroweth to work and write that horrible horrible paper. My professors do not love me. And should they? I demand they do so. Yet, I still have to write the paper, whether I be loved or not. This is the obligation of life.

"Welcome to my new spot on the internet.  As some of you know, I used to have a nice place over at JayLowe.com called The Red Zone.  Let's just pretend that was a pilot for this column.  I'm going to try to do a better job with Inside the Red Zone, or ""ITRZ"".  By the way, if anyone can come up with a better name, please feel free to send it my way.  Anyway... in the words of Scott D., now we go!    When people talk about hot actresses, why isn't Rene Russo ever brought into the discussion?   Is it any wonder that Harris, the old pitcher from Major League, uses Vaseline, KY Jelly and a little ""jal-uh-pee-no"" to fool hitters and eventually gets rocked by the Yankees?  He's not throwing harder than 50 mph.   Normally, I cheer for the underdog.  That's part of the reason I cheer for whoever is playing the Yankees, the Lakers, the Raiders, the Cowboys, etc.  But with Lance Armstrong gunning for his 6th straight Tour de France victory, I'm pulling for him big-time.  Call it a little American patriotism shining through on the 4th of July.     When Cerrano hits the ball out to tie the game against the Yankees, why does he carry the bat with him?  This has always bothered me.  I realize he's got a relationship with his bats (""hats for bats"") but still.  Only an idiot would carry their bat around the bases like that.   I'd like everyone know that I cooked chicken in a skillet this weekend.  Twice! I used olive oil, a lemon paper marinade.  I even cooked rotini pasta, a long time Big Red speciality, at the same time.  This is pretty revolutionary for me.   I've been getting a lot of crap lately from Bertsch and Heather who have been hammering me for not seeing some ""classic"" movies.  So I've never seen Rocky, so I've never seen Sixteen Candles, so I've never seen Pretty in Pink.  Why is this a big surprise?  These movies were made before I was 10.  Secondly, so what if I haven't seen them?  I've never heard anyone say these were some of the best movies ever made.  I realize Rocky won the Oscar for Best Picture.  So did Titanic.  What's the big deal?    I've got a bone to pick...   ESPN has been doing their best and worst lists of the last 25 years.  First of all, didn't they just do this?  Secondly, are they on crack?  They did their top 25 sports movies of all-time and Rudy came in at #24.  24???? Are you kidding?  So here are my top five sports movies of all-time:  Honorable mention:  Bull Durham, Jerry Maguire, Tin Cup.  5.  Miracle.    This movie overcomes a major personal obstacle. I saw this movie while on easily the worst blind date of my life. This girl will remain nameless, but let's call her Amy.  Amy, who was a big hockey fan, wouldn't shut the hell up during the whole movie. She kept asking when Gordon Bombay was going to show up, asking when the guys were going to do the Flying V.  Listen, if she didn't want to see the movie in the first place, she should have said so.  But that's neither here, nor there.  Very good movie. It goes to show that no matter where I am, what I'm doing, the U-S-A chant is pretty powerful.  4.  Major League.    So many great lines.  Very hard to put this movie as low as four.  Rick Vaughn, Jake Taylor, and the most under-rated character in the movie, manager Lou Brown (""there's two or three all-stars on this team"").  It's an all-star cast with a young Wesley Snipes, Rene Russo in her first feature film, Charlie Sheen at his best, Bob Uecker doing his thing.  Well done from start to finish.  3.   Rudy.    I can't believe ESPN had this at 24.  It's a movie about true friendship and having your dreams come true.  You get a fat Jon Favreau, an angry Charles Dutton and a role so perfectly fitted for Sean Astin that he could never do anything else without having everyone say, ""look, it's Rudy!"".  When Rudy runs out onto the field for the kickoff, I get a lump in my throat.  Everytime.  I can't help it.  2.  Field of Dreams.    I was talking to my friend Sara a few weeks ago and she couldn't believed I liked this movie.  Couldn't understand why I'd ever want to watch it, much less watch dozens of times.  So I hung up on her.  I questioned whether our friendship was over.  To me, ""You wanna have a catch?"" still ranks as the most tear-jerking line in the history of American cinema.    1.  Hoosiers.    Obviously, this is a no-brainer.  I don't have to explain this.  Everyone knows how the story is going to end and yet, you're captivated.  The only downside is that Norman Dale is a bad game coach (how are you NOT going to give the last shot to Jimmy?!?).  Even so, Hoosiers sits atop this list, without a doubt."	m

The main reson I'm doing it is to save some memories and preserve the great music.  My big problem is that almost all of my tapes from then are degraded to the point that they're nearly worthless.  I was hoping that as a community we could find the best recordings among us to preserve.  I'm certainly not looking to make any money from this and I have no intentions of infringing on the artistry of the music.  Frankly, I never really saw any troubles with the artists because the bands we're talking about are for the most part defunct.  Morally, I certainly don't feel like it's stealing or anythings since we all supported these bands by buying their tapes and going to their shows and even in some instances being their friends.	f

"Hosted by Kim O'Donnel washingtonpost.com Staff Writer Thursday, April 29, 2004; 12:00 PM  Released MAY 5, 2004  A graduate of Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, Kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.   The transcript follows.   Editor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   Kim O'Donnel: Hello out there. It's been a while since our last get-together. For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month. Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: ""flexatarian."" I think that would aptly describe my eating habits. Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. So, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. Onward...   _______________________   I'm a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?    Kim O'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I've not gotten my act together on setting a date. It'll be sometime in May or June, probably June. Funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend. Think green, kids. It's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!   _______________________   Frederick, Md.: I'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)   Kim O'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation. Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. Check out shawguides.com   _______________________   St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. I don't think he gets enough calcium. Any suggestions? And can you tell me how to make a smoothie? After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator?   Kim O'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium. Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. I don't add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. Doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim. Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I'd love to make my own. Any suggestions? I'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?   Kim O'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!   _______________________   Prince Frederick, Md.: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet. Most of what I've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. I still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.   I can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. But what really turned me off about meat was reading ""Fast Food Nation."" It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. I recommend everyone read it, as well as ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair.   Kim O'Donnel: Prince,  Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there's Crescent Dragonwagon's ""Passionate Vegetarian"", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,   My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. Any ideas as to what it is?  Thanks a bunch!   Kim O'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? I am looking for big pieces, not something that is ""ground."" I have tried a couple of things without much luck. Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?   _______________________   Anonymous: I have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. They sell it at Whole Foods.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that's what I was thinking...   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: For meatless jambalaya, I'd use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. Some seitan might be good for texture also.   Kim O'Donnel: Ah, bueno. Thanks, Silver!   _______________________   Reston, Va.: I'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)?   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes!  Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings.  Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings.    _______________________   Veggie burger: I've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? Not lentils, please (ewww...)   Kim O'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details. I don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home...   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms ""Chik Nuggets"" - they also come in patties. My son particularly likes to have this when friends who ""hate"" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something NOT chicken.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, Arlington.   _______________________   East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim!   You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Hey EFC,  Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m Works really well, and no, you do get what you need.   _______________________   Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it's called the Natural  Gourmet Cookery School  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City.  They also do dinners open to the public on most  Friday evenings. Sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.   Kim O'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up!   _______________________   New York, N.Y.: Kim,   I need fruit help. I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? What should I look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? I'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!;   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit. I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat. It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.   _______________________   For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   Kim O'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.   _______________________   Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim!   When you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. It's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every Saturday.   Kim O'Donnel: Very glad that you've reminded me, Alexandria.   _______________________   Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share. For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good. I finally found the secret: rosewater. You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good. I have been drinking them every day this week!   Kim O'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: Hi Kim -  I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... I've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.   I'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. Do you have any ideas?   Love your chats - you rock!   Kim O'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver. Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. Sounds nice.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? Also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in? I'm not sure where to start...   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry? Talk to me.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim,  White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients -  I  bought the wrong kind of beans. Here's  what I came up with so far - what am I  missing (or how can I vary it)?   tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   Kim O'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many ""salatini"" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. Lemon zest is great. Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   Fairfax, Va: Kim,   My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I'm a happy meat eater. I'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but I'd like to do it on the grill. What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (And how do I do it)?   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. Serve over rice. You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,  Speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?) Is it coming back? Do you know when? It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, it is. Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7.   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello-  Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? Preferably in MD. THanks   Kim O'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I'm betting will come out next month. Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?   _______________________   Rockville, Md.: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. In making this at home would you recommend the ""plain old salted"" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   Kim O'Donnel: Plain, unsalted. You got it...   _______________________   Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: I'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so I'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? There's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I'd like to modify. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. I don't know for sure. My copy of ""Dairy-Free Cooking"" offers some ""cream sauce"" ideas...so why not??   _______________________   Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What's cooking chat. One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. Keep in a cold place overnite. Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India. Lassi is usually salty. I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. Yummy  Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing!   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   St. Louis, Mo.: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the ""Horn of the Moon"" cookbook by Ginny Callan. Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. A follow-up book, ""Beyond the Moon,"" includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) Worth a look.   Kim O'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou. Thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   Suitland, Md.: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand? Something that actually tastes like cheese? I am looking for a block that I can grate.   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello Kim-  I have an eggplant question for you. I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it. I know it is simple but can't figure it out. I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy. It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. I don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. Can you help me? Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda. Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? Do tell...   _______________________   Boston, Mass.: Hi Kim,   What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it?  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees. But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. It's a great treat!   _______________________   Indian Head, Md.: Hi Kim! My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.   They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!   J   Kim O'Donnel: Let's see...I'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use?   Kim O'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I'm thinking of a curry. I've got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   Oxford, Miss: I'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I'm getting bored with my recipe. Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?   Kim O'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r b? You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim. Still struggling with the white sweet potatos. Any ideas?   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest...   _______________________   Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - I'm specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini I bought  yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...   also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?  thanks in advance   Kim O'Donnel: Salt really well. Use a brush. Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size...   _______________________   Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers'  market. My great-grandfather sold there every  Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market. There are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on Friday...   Kim O'Donnel: Nice story, Reston. Thanks for the memories...   _______________________   Re: strawberry picking: Butler's Orchard, in Germantown (MD). You can call their phone line to find out what's available when.   Kim O'Donnel: Excellent!   _______________________   Laurel, MD: Chiming in:   Rice and beans: I've been planning a reverse black beans  and white rice using white beans and some of the black  rice, seasoned with a South-east Asian theme.   Kim O'Donnel: Ooh...I like that...   _______________________   Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim.  Wanted to share a great sauce recipe. I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. Very healthy and delicious. And with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat.   ~Chef in training   Kim O'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas. Keep sending reports of your experiments!   _______________________   Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? I.E. does the can say ""White Beans"" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? Thanks for the insight.   Kim O'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans. They are interchangeable.   _______________________   Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread?   Kim O'Donnel: A can of drained white beans. Whiz in a food processor. Olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. Taste. Lemon zest is nice, too. Taste. Add more seasoning if needed. Taste for smoothness, too. You're good to go.   _______________________   Arlington, VA: Hi,   I hope you can help me. I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. The only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings. I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in Fear Factor eating worms. I think it's a texture thing. Do you have any suggestions?   Kim O'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend. Introduce her to a farmer. Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. Let me know how it goes...   _______________________   Kim O'Donnel: Out of time, folks. Thanks for all the good stuff. Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! The air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! Promise to be back for end of May, and in meatime, join me for the regular Tuesday free for all..Best to you.   _______________________    ÂŠ 2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive"	f
"I guess not. I mean, I'm little, and a girl.  I was walking home this morning from cashing my check and buying milk, and there was a man on my corner with a beautiful, beautiful dog. I stepped aside a little when I stepped up onto the curb, because I didn't want to invade the pretty dog's space, but I guess the human thought I was avoiding her, because he said ""She's all right,"" presumably meaning that she wouldn't bite me. Of course she wouldn't bite me! She was totally calm, just enjoying the sunshine. Still, I guess it was nice of him to assuage my nonexistent fear. I mean, supposing I was terrified of dogs! Of course, then his reassurances would probably not have helped. Anyway, I said, ""No, she's beautiful,"" and asked what breed she is. I am terrible with breeds, even purebreeds. She was a Rottweiler-Beagle mix, which I really can't imagine except that I saw it with my own eyes.  I don't really understand why people are so terrified of Rottweilers. I've known a few, and they were the nicest dogs I have  ever  met. Ditto Pit Bulls. In fact, my favorite Rottweiler was about twice as big as me (seriously, he was enormous) and was the most mellow, friendly dog on earth. I think his name was Randy. His owner is the only person I've ever known who was murdered.   Anyway.   I have a pressing problem. I am up to  Fool For Love  on my  Buffy  season 5 DVDs, and I don't feel like watching it. I have had enough Spike. But I don't want to skip! I've gone totally in order so far!"	f
On Wednesday night I went out for drinks with a friend of mine here in Ottawa.  L took me to a pub on Bank St that had the strangest client mix I have ever seen, at least recently.  There were highly polished government types through to a pair of old (I am going to go out on a limb and say border-line alcoholic), smelly men.  We had one drink and decided that the atmosphere was not all that cool and it was a bit odorous.  We picked up a bottle of wine and headed back to L's.  The major topic of the evening was blogging.  L is a veteran  urlLink photoblogger  and actually knows the 5th Muse that my other friend E is rather obsessed with.  I am making a vow to be a more dilligent blogger.   I am so enjoying my time here in Ottawa.  I love seeing people who I have not seen in a long time and I love the fact that I can wonder around all day and not see a single person that I know.  So different then Charlottetown, where you see and get seen constantly.  Last night (Thursday) I had dinner with a friend from university and kindergarten, and her new husband.  I had been at their wedding back in June.  They have a really nice appartment in the Glebe.  Neither of them are very domestic and they are still waiting for their sofa to arrive.  If it arrives while I am here I am invited to their sofa warming party.  Hanging out with married people is kind of weird, I don't have all that many married friends and most of them do not live anywhere near me, so there is no hanging out on a regular basis.  It was actually really nice, we had a good gossip about people we know from school and from PEI and I really do like her husband.  They were set up by a mutual friend two years ago and now they are married, so to anyone who wants to set me up I am all for it.	f
Dear MTA:  How come whenever I am waiting for a train, I have to wait for 10 minutes or more?  How come I have to wait during rush hour?  And how come when I am waiting, a train going in the opposite direction seems to come every 3 minutes?  For $2 a ride, I shouldn't have to wait.......EVER!!!!!!	f
"OK, so let me see if I got all this...      The government will mandate that I give some of my money to securities firms to manage for retirement and health costs.  They will have deposits in turn secured by the Treasury and they can speculate at will in free and deregulated markets.     Schools will be run by corporations, presumably with a board of directors that can mandate an all non-union workforce.  Schools may choose then to invest their resources where it does the most good and, let's face it, some kids are more cost effective to educate than others.     If I am unemployed I can use all the funds in my individual account, provided there are any. If employers make a habit of laying off thousands while their accountants with their freshly-minted MBAs tackle tough learning curves, there is no deterance to encumber them.    If I am poor I will get a housing voucher that I may use to apply for a portion of a bloc grant that flucuates according to the political winds.  If the grant has run out, the voucher can be used along with others to create paper mache housing.    I can get ""soap, soup and salvation"" (thank you Lone Justice) through the good folks at the local house of worship if I am properly God fearing.  If I am not, than I may go to hell.    After spending five years working in the commodity houses shouting and waving hand signals, I do not particularly relish my rights as a citizen being subordinate to the will of the market in most every aspect.  The market can be a loony old coot that suffers spells on some days and talks perfect sense on others. Smart money says you always treat him with a certain respect, like you do a slightly batty old uncle.  You don't let him drive to church on Sundays, but you let him complain about your driving from the back seat with a certain amount of toleration.    There are certain things that the Corporatists excel in and certain things they do not.  It is truly amazing that there is a privately funded and fabricated spaceship that is shooting to the stars. If we would have waited until it was feasible for the private sector to take on the challenge, we would have lost the missile race and the technology race and forfeited our leadership in the new age.  In 1910 most paved roads were toll roads built by private consortiums. It was decided that to increase the flow of goods and commerce this could be a public concern.  Earlier, the American Whig Party (remember them?) were behind the ideal of the common infrastructure, in formation at the time, being best administered by the broadest range of citizens possible.  Lincoln, of course, prior to becoming the first elected Republican president was a Whig during the time he served in the House.    Everyone who has ever lived in a condominium knows that there are certain common amenities to be shared and it is necessary to have some say as to how they are managed.  Many who have served on a condo board cease to ever contemplate running for public office because they have terrible night sweats and sudden screaming fits.  Still it is necessary.  I believe the neocons wish to employ as much control as possible over the public sector while all the while extolling the common man striving for a finer tomorrow.    The small individual farmer, the small business owner, the one-man-shop, none of these play on an even field with the Corporatists and their powerful lobbies.  They are more revered for their mythic status than their status in the economy.  They deserve representation on par with large corporate interests who practically have bought seats in the Legislature.  Italy in the 30s actually let corporate interests have seats in their parliament. It was called fascism and it begged to be destroyed.    The Third Way is to balance the corporate, the private (as separate from corporate), and public sectors so that the interests of the people are best served.  The people, represented not by corporate lobbies or even political parties necessarily but by our direct involvement, have a say in our common assets.     Instead of employers controlling an individuals access to health care and retirement accounts while forbidding access to collective bargaining, we can collectively bargain via our vote with our public servants to exercise the full weight of our authority--unhindered by corporate control that hides behind the mask of the individual while displaying the powers relative to a nation/state.  If 80% percent of the public desire a single-payer health care plan, then they should get it.    The Third Way is not the end of private property or a socialist utopia.  It seeks to define where capitalism has a predominant interest and where common interest, or stakeholder interest shall carry porportionate weight.  There are some things to precious to be left to the will of the market.               urlLink Read more!"	m
Okay, now to recap the entire day.  Woke up late today, got to band at 7:20, I hate band...After band, went to English, got a 0 on grade, then to tap and Cisco.  Got another failing grade in Cisco and then I went to physics.  Physics was fun, did vector stuff, made fun of Hurst.  Good times.  Got home at 3 and played DOD with matt, PWN3D everyone with a friggin 4:1 score.  That means I killed 4 people for every one death I had on average.  It was great.  BLAH, I hate school, I hate band, I hate people, I hate everything, I hate you most likely.  End...	m

Reagan News:no university, and stem cell research  First this:http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/nation/8554019.htm?1c yeah no university named after the former President I'm a bit disappointed but hey.  Now  urlLink this  dissapoints me though.MRs reagan may support this but I sure hope she leaves or would leave Ronnie out of it, him being a man of God I highly doubt he'd be a supporter whether it cure him or not.

So I didn’t start my experiences in the Middle East the way I wanted. This stuff is minor but I got to tell the good with the bad.  Earlier I gave my two cents about the baggage detail. So we get off the plane and board buses to travel for an hour to Camp Doha. This is the main base for the military in this region. Troops  civilians filter in and out, to and from the theatre through this base. This base appears to have a lot of activity. Once at the base we, meaning military  civilians that were deployed from CRC this past week, were dropped off at this staging area. The staging area has two large white open-air tents side by side, one for the military and one for the civilians. When I say open air I mean there are walls on the sides just none on the front or back. One thing that was very noticeable was the heat. Inside those tents you knew you were in the Middle East. A coordinator who is in charge of the civilians meets with us and gives some briefings about what to do and where to go. He then starts handing people off to there point of contacts (POC). After handing everyone off there were us three from ITT and there was no one there to meets us. No biggie. The coordinator tells us to grab our belongings go to the other tent and wait as he will go and contact our POC. Well after about the second hour standing in this hot ass tent waiting for someone that looks like they’re never going to show up we ventured out on our own. After about an hour of search (which required us to bother several people) we found the office of this coordinator. Honestly a few minutes more in the heat and I would have passed out. Rocio didn’t look in too good either. Jim, well that guy seems to be part android because he’s so straightforward and emotionless to almost all situations. In fact I worry that, god forbid, his base was ever bombed he might not run, he’d stand and watch the show. But who knows (I’m kidding Jim in case you read this). It turns out that the coordinator dropped the ball and failed to contact our POC and left us hanging while everyone else left. Fortunately there was a happy ending. We talk with this other coordinator who was very nice and helpful. He promptly called our POC. Our POC (Mike Davis) picked us up and took us on our merry way. In their defense though, this process had just been change to this base where in the past it was handled on another base. So they’re still working out the communication between the offices. Just too bad we had to be the guinea pigs.  As I mentioned life here on this base seem busy. A lot of troops walking around, shopping and going here and there. One thing we’ve all noticed is that the many people we’ve encountered are good-hearted, helpful, considerate people. They happily exchange information about themselves or what life is like downrange. Before coming here, through other sources, I was led to believe that the military didn’t care about and even despised civilian contractor because of the pay we get. Maybe this attitude is different in the theatre, but so far I enjoy meeting these soldiers. Now that I’m here and I see a snippet of there life I can truly say, and not that I didn’t mean it before, but I truly have a new respect for these men  women here. They deserve a lot more credit and respect then we give them.  Our living conditions are somewhat similar to those at Fort Bliss. We are in an open bay inside a big warehouse like structure with bunk beds and wall lockers. Directly outside by the entrance to our bay are some tiki torches, so I call this place the Tiki Palace. There are many people here that kinda do there own thing in their own space. This also is the primary housing for ITT folks as we have talked with many of them, either coming in from the theatre or going out. They too seem friendly and helpful.  One thing I think I haven’t mentioned is the food. To my surprise Army food is pretty good. Of course I can’t eat everything but what I manage to find is mostly very tasty. And I’m talking about both of the bases I’ve been to, Fort Bliss and Camp Doha. On top of that, there’s the fast food court by the PX that has several chains; Subway, Pizza Inn (it’s like Pizza Hut), Baskin  Robins and Kentucky Fried Chicken to name a few. I’ve already eaten at Subway  Pizza Inn. So much for losing weight.  So I just continue on through the process waiting to see what happens next.	m

Thanks to SC Hotline for tracking down the original Roll Call article where Kevin Geddings again proves to be an ass:   urlLink Roll Call   Tenenbaum outpolled Geddings's candidate for governor by more than 120,000 votes.  She got 45,000 more votes than Lindsay Graham in his Senate race.  Granted, she was up against weak competition.  But, going back to 1998, she outpolled Hodges by 37,000 votes and beat a decent Republican candidate, David Eckstrom, by 161,000 votes.  She even beat Eckstrom in his home county, Lexington (you remember Lexington, don't you), albeit by a little over 200 votes.	m

Hey guys...   I told my friend Tres that I would read with him through Proverbs and post about it.  Well...I dropped that ball and basicly did none of it.  So I am repenting from that now. Sorry Tres  way to go for keeping it up!! I love reading your blog and comments.  Always good stuff.    Last night we just played some games with the kids.  It was a lot of fun! We played a game that is almost the same as ultimate frizbee.  The difference is you use a roll of toilet paper covered in duck tape instead.  Also there is a box around the goal that no one can step in except the goalie.  It is tons of fun! We played for about half an hour!   It was good just to hang out and play with the kids without caring if they listen or soak anything in....just taking time to be on their level and be a kid.  Sometimes you have to really do that to get back to what it is all about.  Next week one of the elders is going to teach to them.  Get ready for a 180!! :)	m

حافظه يكي از دوستام در قسمت جاودانگي نوشته بود:  اگه ميتونستيم يك قسمت از حافظه يا خاطراتمون رو پاك كنيم خوب بود حالا جاودانگي نبود مهم نيست  حرف جالبي زدند. مثلا اگه ممكن بود ما بيست سال زندگي كنيم بعد خاطراتي كه برامون ناراحت كننده است رو پاك كنيم شايد شاد تر زندگي ميكرديم. اما اول بايد به اين سوال جواب بديم كه: چه تضميني هست كه در بيست سال بعدي دوباره عين همون ناراحتي ها يا اشتنباهات رو تكرار نكنيم؟ البته ممكنه همين قابليت پاك كردن حافظه يك جور جاودانگي باشه چون به هر حال به ما يك احساس مشابه هم ميده.در واقع شايد ما ميخواييم جاودانه باشيم كه اشتباهاتمون رو فراموش كنيم. ما ناراحتيم چون وقتي اشتباه ميكنيم ديگه فرصتمي نداريم اما اگه عمرمون بينهايت باشه يا بتونيم حافظه رو پاك كنيم جفتش يك نتيجه رو ميده  ميدونيد ما آدما جاودانه نيستيم. علممون هم كامل نيست. توي دنياي بي دليلي هم زندگي ميكنيم. اما يك نكته مثبت اين دنيا داشته باشه اينه كه ما  تجربه  كسب ميكنيم البته ما اين گزينه رو داريم كه توي زندگيمون از تجربه هامون استفاده كنيم و خودمون رو گول بزنيم يا اينكه همچنان واقعيتها را كه ميبينيم بپذيريم و باز سوال كنيم من از يك چيزي مطمع هستم : ما نيومديم كه فقط زندگي كنيم.! شايد اومديم كه سوال كنيم. شايد كسي كه آوردتمون ميخواسته چيزاي ديگري رو بگه كه نتونسته! شايد … اما مطمعنا فقط زندگي بي معني نبوده	m
"Fuck. That's all I can say. I just died. the math test...i hate myself. I DIDNT KNOW THE LATS THREE!!!!! AND THERE WAS ONLY 11 QUESTIONS.

I screw everything up. *shoots self*. wait- lets say it in spanish! *le dispara a su propio*yay.   Nothing's gone well the last few days, that's for sure. And little things people did didnt make it any better. That's for sure. It's good to know at least AISHA wont get pissed at me for little things. Or flirting or crap. I felt all special today. I wore this new black(the bets color ever) shirt my dad bought, and it was all cool. ANd I was happy. And i slept in. Taht was good. ANd now I'm alone with a teacher. Crap. Jeez..that cared me. She turned around and asked me if I was doing a blog. I thought she'd get mad or something. At least she wasn't. I guess we can do whatever we want in our freetime here. Except porn. Damn. SOrry, aisah, can' open the pics of yourself u sent me. lol j/k  Im gonna go over to kimerly's house after school and watch degrassi at like 5.

I'll probably call Aisha, dnce in the nude(my fantasies are all coming true), read somehting and get depressed, talk to aisha som more, think about everything wrong in my life, talk to aisha about it, think about why Brighton's still mad at me, keep talking to aisha in confusion. Sounds like a night!!!! I wanna stay up til 3ish, cause I always get a better sleep that way. And I want the other shower cap.  And I don't wanna be a lone. but oh well. ""that'll do, pig.""

They were'nt that good. SOme were though. ""money' by pink floyd is not a good song, if you ever wondered about it.  You think posts from a long time ago get rolled off on this? I hope not. Tomorrow I'll have been writing a week! :)  Aisha....a picture. not of kitty, but of the other person in your room at 1 AM. And, once again, not that i want it ro anything, for the reasons previously mentioned.  Liked your email. It was sweet.  I don't remember getting any sweet email from Brighton, hm? lol  Much love  peace  ~alex"	m
I'm having busy days. A bad experience with .net and I was wondering, how am I going to fix my website? Well for newcomers, I already have a complete flash website. I’ve uploaded it 2 days ago  marketed it. SMS, Mail, Instant Messages, Chat Room advertising everything I’ve done to tell the world that I was online. It was a good experience. My mood was pregnant. It is like buying a home in downtown New York or Sunset Boulevard. lol even Upstate New York is not a bad idea.    I was dying to see my guest book  No. of visitors. The first one to sign in was my dear bro. Heramb .. Well he is a nice guy. Always funny … yet somber at times but even that solemnity has a tinge of laughter in it. Whenever I watch Will Smith , I find Heramb so much reminiscent of him .. lol like I did , yesterday, when I was watching MIB II on HBO. He was online that night and provided me with good hints n tips regarding my website. Well he was kinda busy wid damsels …. I know it’s high time for him to get some one … (hope His parents r not reading this:P)   The one comment I was keenly waiting for was of Ashutosh. Now He is my dear bro. too but exactly opposite of me. A Very Shy Guy , as he loves to call himself , skinny , always wearing the naïve specs of intelligence. As expected he sent me a long mail very next day with heapz of tips n tricks. It was a good mail to read. He diagnosed the website’s present condition well  presented new ideas. I replied him immediately expressing my joy for an apt reply  thanking him for his program (which hotmail deleted cuz an .exe file as an attachment is considered as a potential threat.)   Before him, I met a good friend of mine. Anu, as I call her wid love, I met her few months down the line in chat rooms n sent her summer of 69 song in Mail :P … Since then I never chatted wid her in Private Messages. As the juggernaut of time rolled, we met again tht night. I’ven’t seen her in person, but I can sense her Suave nature  Sprightly presence around. I guess u don’t have to meet people to know them, Its something inside that ticks. Or else peepz live together for number of yrs n feel astonished every now n then bout their partners. The best thing : SHE LOVES GAMING LIKE ME. I Dunno, How good she is in CS (Counter Strike) as she proclaims. Let me have a game wid her someday... n let me see who get the most FRAGS.   Back to the 31’st may …. I was thinking the whole day bout nature of my website. I had a very crude, rookie design online. My main intention was to put up a website for game programmers, loaded wid tuts n games. Some sections for vb/vc programmers and discussion forums should be handy.   To be frank, I was happy when I designed my flash based website. Later I found it very spiteful. A failed attempt of a Greenhorn as u call or a Neophyte (Thanks to Barron’s :P). Suddenly I found myself visualizing bout the website more and more.   I needed a sleek, super sleek design wid minimum of mess n loadz n loadz of useful links  tutorials.  I will definitely have some flash part in it. Huh tha’s the best way to show ur knowledge bout the damn thing. As a hard ass perfectionist I’m, I believe certain things in life represent U. 1> Your resume 2> Your matrimonial Ad and 3> Your website. If you have spelling mistakes, disorganized content, perplexed design then it shows negligence on ur part  not the finesse you want to depict.	m

"one initial goal is vision improvement.  last year the reading  glasses came...first only for evening reading.  this year i need  them for any close up reading. can't make out the calorie contents in the grocery anymore. i won't break down and carry those glasses everywhere i go and i refuse to buy into the theory of getting stronger  glasses incrementally over time to lessen eyestrain.   my committment is to take matters into my own hands, research vision improvement techniques, and of course include all foods proven beneficial to eyesight.  right off i'm thinking eye  palming and carrots.  eye yoga videos and cucumber slice eye facials.  secondly, less teleVision watching (believe it or not, that's how i broke my foot ten weeks ago), and errr......less laptop.  : (   yesterday i LOVED my 3 meals. unusually slow, with long chewing.    tea, fatfree half n half and stevia  ""emotional nutrition"" (willie's term)   large apple    2 dates        huge head of chopped romaine w/fatfree vinegarette   1# steamed kale       head of chopped romaine topped with   3/4 cup pink beans and ff vinegarette   1# steamed broccoli  grand total of 750 cals. my calorie goal perameter in general is between 700-1000 for now, and eventually tightening the gap."	f

All I wanted to say is that I am going to quit. I will quit worrying, quit trying to control stuff, quit trying to keep balance and play it safe. Maybe it's just a way to say I'm tired.

"Yeah, there are a lot of things that melissa and i find funny, but apparently not everyone laughs with us.   We watched Kundun in class today adn talked about Tibet and China after the movie.  There was this leader in China whose name sounds like ""Who Ya Banged"".  So of course after hearing the prof say this a few times I really wanted to make a comment to Melissa, but I bit my tongue.  I look over at her and I can tell she wanted to laugh, her face was getting red from stifling laughter.  So i lost it and that made Melissa break as well.  Yeah we were the only 5 year olds in the class that laughed. Come on, where's your sense of bathroom humor?"	f
Well my conversation today was cut short with Karissa due to poor cell phone reception. Basically I told her I would be there tomorrow and that was about all I had signal for.    But since that story is short let me tell you about the Bus Service in this country!  My problems with the bus service started with ordering the tickets.  I have come to the conclusion that it is no wonder why people choose to fly.  I have never been treated with the disrespect and lack of regard for me as a customer like i have been by the bus system.  In fact I plan on writing a letter to someone over there at the bus company and if you know me I don't write letters very often!  They sell tickets with no idea how many people are on the bus or will be on the bus.  They are rude, I had one driver actually cuss at me, overall if I was grading it I would give it an F as they lack any regard for the customer at all.  Basically I wrote this during a stop at a truck stop, on a bus I was never supposed to be on!  Thanks to the oversale of tickets I am headed to Louisville KY! A destination I was never intended to go to.  But I am hoping to catch the Detroit bus there so I can make Karissa's B-day party on time.  All I can say is I would like to thank Greyhound for crappy service and   SFW   for making this whole thing possible!	m
Royal Race.   OK people, I have a serious announcement to make...Matt and myself have entered the 'dummy downhill' race at Sunshine. This is basically where you make something on skis and push it off a hill and who evers gets to the bottom first, wins....it's a simple premiss.  Now whilst we were trying to come up with a theme for our dummy, the only great idea we hit was the following.  Our dummy is gonna be the queen on her throne! and the throne will be on skis!!! it's gonna be some funny shit...we've managed to source some skis and we're waiting to get a chair...the queen will be played by an inflatable granny that one of our mates got as a birthday pres!  if anybody has some suggestions to improve our little project then let us know...oh and she will be dragging a little corgi behind her!  i will keep u all posted on the build as it takes place...the race is on Sunday 2nd May.	m
I saw the new Harry Potter movie with morning with two of my friends.  It was kinda a disappointment.  I liked the first two more, but it wasn't a total waste.  Today has just been an awful day.  I didn't feel good this morning but I made myself go to the movie anyway.  Then I remembered I have the SAT tomorrow which I'm dreading.  Last but not least, Maury is going up north for a week which means I have nothing to do pretty much.  I saw his play last night and it was...uh...well it wasn't the best I've seen.  The camp is going ok.  It's really early in the morning.	f

Well, it's all becoz of Wah Kon  I finally got into here! I strongly believe that this is much better compared to LJ. I've been using LJ for years  feel that I need a change.  A bit busy today, just came up with the new duty schedule for next month. I have a weird feeling here, ever since I take up the responsibility to arrange the schedule, everyone in the office started to pass me small notes stated the off-days that they want. I tot i'm the one who arrange everything but seems that they are messing up the system.    Will update more ...	f
Am happy to report that there were no major acts of discrimination at Pablo's party. If anyone disagrees say so.

Happy New Year!  Happy new year to everyone, i hope that its a good one!  My new years eve was fairly uneventful, but pleasant all the same.  Now i am just listening to the fireworks and the cars zooming by honking, and well, honestly i am not all that excited about it.  Tomorrow (my bad, today) is just going to be another day.   Thinking about Miss Perfect  Last night i was asked a couple of questions that really got me thinking.  What if the perfect girl comes along and you let her slip away?  What if the perfect girl for you doesn't think you are the perfect guy for her?  And so the more i thought about it, the more i realized: what if i have already let the perfect girl get away?  And if i think she is perfect, but she apparently doesn't, can she be perfect for me?	m
thank God for sanitary napkins.  i am just so grateful to the wise ass who put cottonlike material together, put adhesive on it so that women like me can have protection whenever it's that time of the month.  it's one hell of a scientific breakthrough.  not the telephone or the light bulb although i cannot imagine what it would be like to change your sanitary napkins in the dark.  the blood, the gore. what a frigging mess that would be, i bet.  monthly period also gives a sort of lame excuse (although women do get away with it, sorry guys) for women to act in a not-so-acceptable manner.  they can bitch (but i must say i can do that with or without the monthly period), they can be horny, they piss you off and shit and it can be easily attributed to PMS.  i love it but i hate the fucking cramps and abdominal pains.  it makes me wonder, how the hell can i be great mother if i don't want to experience the pain of giving birth which i hear is like ten times more painful than what women experience on a monthly basis? makes me wish the stork stories were actually true.    *nuninu*    i love my friends.  i've said it a zillion times. sometimes the people who aren't exactly related to you, they're the ones who understand you better.  they're the ones who help you when you need something.  well, most of the time.  blood   is   thicker than water, no doubt about that.  but water can turn into gas, or solid, blood can't.	f
Today as I woke up i looked out, and YES the weather is finally  good ! The sun has stopped hididing and now I can go  partying  at the islands with my friends.

"Gotta work tomorrow.   The big news today: We turned sovereignity over to the Iraqis today (Two days early, even! George is on top of his game!). Yeah, today Bremer shipped out, after putting some final crippling laws on the interim government. Not only do the new laws make it easy for the US to ensure that Western-friendly candidates will be elected, they leave room for heinous human rights violations. From now on, U.S. contractors are  immune  from Iraqi law while doing whatever job the government has overpaid them to do.   The Iraqi government is mainly symbolic, as we still have to enforce the peace and bear the costs.  I read in the newspaper the other day that we were in Germany and Japan for  sixty  years. Can you imagine us in this quagmire for five more years, or a decade? Sadly enough, it seems that because of the neo-cons some of my friends or acquaintances might have to go to Iraq after high school.   I was too tired from Hobe's birthday to do anything today, so I watched  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and read two Stephen King novellas. Stephen King is actually quite a good writer. I won't claim to like most of his commerical stuff, but I love his short story comps and, of course, the  Dark Tower  series, one of the most epic fantasy series concieved since  Lord of the Rings . Also, it isn't your cookie-cutter elves and goblins, either. It is like a sad romance Western laced with King's commitment to seek the truth of human nature. If you haven't ever read a King book, you should. His style of writing is interesting and easy to read.    Office Space  is coming on in a few minutes. I'd better wrap this up.  The Jetpack turning seventeen was a weird event. When I first got to his house I had a ""where has the time gone"" moment. I mean, I knew this kid back when my mom still liked me. It also made me think about how unfair time is. Jet is seventeen, as is Hannah. One is graduated from high school, and the other still has two years to go. I've always felt mature for my age, but everyone says that I just hate everything. We did some stuff, which was fun but not really interesting enough to record here, and went to sleep rather late. Now, we had like eight people crammed down in his boathouse, and it was pure torture trying to sleep. When I went to sleep at four, I was sleeping on a futon with two other people. My feet stuck way off the end and I was miserable. Sometime during the night, I fell off the futon and was kicked in the face several times.  My teeth hurt."	m
"10 days to go - we are all feeling quite scared and excited all at the same time. Everything is running along nicely and no major catastrophes yet!  The idea of the blog is so that people will be able to keep up with what we are doing in Cape Town. Each day a team member or a few team members will be charged with updating the blog with what has been going on that day. It will get some of our thoughts down on ""paper"" and will also let everyone who is interested know whatwe've been up to for information and for prayers.  Hopefully we will be able to upload photos to the blog mas well which would be rather cool. Won't know to we get out there though.  Viv"	f

Capital Building and sales tax  A group focused on the capital building is wanting the sales tax increase which we have been promised will go back to its original five cents from six to pay for improvements and repairs. Their are some necessary repairs especially after a recent flooding of some of the sections of the building and it is a wonderful building and a necessary one I've seen it and met many who work in it including the governor and his office I'd honestly rather see a rise in sales tax or extension or even permanent raise than one on property or income but at the same time I think fundraising and donations could be useful and perhaps the governor and mayor should seek such things out I am sure many would be happy to do so from businesses to organizations to individuals and of course fundraisers would only raise more money, for instance the mayor is having a park fundraiser this weekend via tickets for floating the river and a bbq so I say why not try these things and try to not extend or make permanent the tax increase.	m
I went to the pub again, but my favourite bar maid was not there.  there was a different one with a CRACKING arse, but it was scant substitute.  Does that even make sense?

"So how about a relevant Friday Five, either 6 days late or 1 day early? I vote yes.   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?  Not failing out of school. Wait, I got on the Law Review thing too, that was pretty sweet. So we'll say that. But that time I ran 2.5 miles in 20 minutes was pretty cool, too.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?  Tough call. Some social situations didn't pan out as I wanted, but most of those were for the best. I wasn't terribly disappointed about much, to tell you the truth.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?  Lots of hot women. Haha! No seriously: lots of hot women.  Also, I'd like to get my summer plans nailed down, hopefully get an unpaid (I aim low) internship somewhere (DC, San Diego, North Dakota - whatever!)   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?  I don't really go in for that sort of stuff, I make resolutions left and right without the influence of a calendar, so I'll just stick with some of those. My resolutions tend to be along the lines of ""I resolve to finally go to the damn dentist"" and ""I resolve to mail my rent today"", so perhaps a more profound thought is in order.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   Over! But I went to a friend's for a party that ended up including a fire, strawberry's with chocolate, and Lucky Charms right out of the box. Good times! If I get around to it, I'll post the 3 or 4 pictures I took in the near future."	m
It would be funny for housemembers to record audio files for other housemembers to use as their answering machine messages.  I initially wanted Sandra to record one for me because it would be rad to have an answering machine message in German, but she is not currently microphone equipped.  So it would be on a strictly voluntary basis. It could be like a christmas gift exchange with voluntary participation.  Whoever gets Belle would win because her voice is cute. Whoever gets me would lose because I will sound retarded.	f

Late-night battles with insomnia that didn't see me really get to sleep until almost 6am, following an Ambien. 4.  Some cat news - changing homes, changing plans - things seem to be working themselves out, but they're still up in the air.  Poor catballs.  I bet they're as tired of moving as I am. 5.  Mentally thumbing through the IKEA catalog and getting ideas for the new apartment.  Limited storage space = some interesting challenges. 6.  Coffee, blogging, and fly-infestation at Green Street - it's too nice outside to be in, but the flies are about to drive me there.   Tonight I'm headed to the fair with  urlLink Sarah .  Today marks ten years since we met - her family moved in next door, and after many years of praying for a female friend in the neighborhood, it seemed my prayers were answered.  The whole gang of us neighborhood kids invited  urlLink Sarah  and her brother out for baseball (and, later, ice cream).  I think she was a little overwhelmed.  See  urlLink last year's post  for more backstory.  I'm so grateful for her presence in my life - I seriously wouldn't have survived the last year, much less the last ten, without her.	f

Greece won the Greece vs. Portugal in the European cup final yesterday which aired live in Houston at 2:00 PM. Paul metup with his dad at 12:30 at the Richmond Arms pub where they had four beers each. When the game ended, we headed out to Berry Hill in Montrose where we metup with Elie and Fotis (who is Greek) and had four marghartitas each, with a few extras for Paul and Fotis. We hung out and danced and got pretty drunk. We then headed over to The Social to watch the fireworks where we had four more margharitas and champagne we brought back from our drunken friend Edward who could no longer hold the champagne bottle and keep balance all at once. DJ Champa rocked the house and luckily we took pictures of the fireworks for us to see the next day. We then made a stop at Whataburger where we ordered a whataburger meal, thick n hearty meal (whatasized) and a strawberry shake for Paul.  Here we are at the start of the night…	f

Danger in the shape of somethin' wild Stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child No one knows who she is or what her name is I don't know where she came from or what her game is ---- Summer is officially here (officially cuz i said so). Strange news this morning as i checked my e-mail... J and his girlfriend broke up. He won’t be going to Vancouver anymore. I’m going for drinks with him later to see what his plans are. He’d already quit his job and told his roommates he was leaving (they found a replacement...) He feels like ass. His chick “wasn’t sure she was ready” for his move there.   Breaking up is so hard to do, or so the saying goes.   Anyway, we’re gonna sit on a patio and drink drinks and chillax. I’ll listen to his woes and try to convince him to stay in Toronto... i don’t know what i would have done in the past few months without him.   When i got back to Toronto from Montreal, i was broken. I didn’t know what to do with myself, who to trust, how to BE a human being... i had become such a recluse bitch, such a loner... and then i literally ran into J. did i ever tell y’all that story?  Cuz it’s a good story: (dreamy flash-back music)... I was living with my then-good-friend C and his girlfriend and another roommate. I was unhappy, having just moved back from Montreal and not wanting to be bothered with people but being forced to live with 3. I had come home from work on Queen (which isn’t necessary for me) to go to the hardware store and get a closet bar hanging thing. I remember thinking to myself, “Should i go see Ricky at his store? Or should i go home instead?!” I decided to go home instead and install the thingy I’d just bought and turned down a random street to go to King.  J?!!??  He looked up, confused, and I took off my sunglasses. “Maria??? Wha? Who? What the hell? How ARE you???”    The last time i had spoken to J, I was leaving his house in Ottawa, going back to Montreal (or was it toronto  before  Mtl?) saying, “I’ll call you when i get home!” but i didn’t. Oops. But that’s what i love about J. Jokes were made, but no hard feelings. He made me feel normal again. He made me feel happy. He made me feel like i was the best friend in the world. He’d call me, we’d go out together, we’d have dinner, we’d go to movies, “hey maria, a bunch of us are doing this do you wanna come?”... there was no question as to whether or not i’d be included in the weekend’s events.  so you can understand that i'm not  toooo  sad that he's not leaving.  Huh, anyway, more on him some other time. we have quite a history and i have to go... work sucks these days. Thank god it’s summer... :)	f

It's the weekend now. Hilary wasn't at school today, so I still don't know how things are going. I might have to wait until monday before I talk to her again. I wish she would call me and tell me what's going on. It could very well be she's just been in a mad mood this week.   I'm thinking about calling her right now, but I'm not quite sure if I should. One part of me says that, she hasn't called because she needs some time. The other part says that if she had good news to tell me she would have told me already. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. I don't like to worry and wonder at the same time. All I've been lately is mopey. She's the most wonderful girl I've ever met. I just wish I knew how she felt.

(This poem convicted me of not enjoying every single moment with my babies...time goes so fast and I've been either unaware or down right frustrated alot of the time).   Bring Me the Babies  Bring me all the babies That want to go to sleep, Or those who want to pat-a-cake, Or ones with cheeks so pink.  Bring me the crying babies, To sing away with song, To soothe away their cares and fears. (They won't be babies long.)  Time slips away and yesterday Is, suddenly, distantly passed. It walks so quiet, by your side. We can't make time last.  Babies love the melodies And vibration of our voices. Oh, bring me, quick, the babies Before they have other choices!  Bring me the hugging babies That just have learned to give a kiss. The sweet slobbery little kisses I'd never want to miss.  A big bear hug would bring me down And I would rock for hours. A lovable, sleepy, baby is Far better than cut flowers.  Lord, give me a song for the babies, on earth, That have heard the sounds of war. Let me hold them on my lap And sing 'til the fighting's o'er.  Let me quiet their little hearts And send all their fears away, Teach them the Name of Jesus, And, especially, how to pray!

Lily's Lullaby- Part SEVEN  The next few days I spent engrossed in thought. I knew I had to get rid of them, but how? I sat pent up in my room- only telling the others slight information. They dismissed me as crazy and generally left me alone. Then one night it hit me. I watched as their torches came slowly over the horizon and I knew what I had to do. The Mayson residence was their safehouse, their haven. To get rid of their haven would be to get rid of them. It was dilapidated, dying already. It wouldn't be hard to burn the hell hole to the ground. I spent that evening looking down upon the monsters, smiling and waving sweetly at Lily who howled and leapt and clawed at the ground and walls. I spent that night anxiously waiting until they left, trudging back to the forest. I slipped out of the house, provisions in my cloak pockets, kicking aside their now dead amusement from hours before. My foot got caught in the man's jacket and I pulled sharply. Something caught my foot and I fell to the ground hard, hitting my head on a sharp stone. I became groggy and everything blurred. The last thing I remember seeing was the dead man's face, leering at me, putrid stale breath choking me slowly. It must of been much later that I woke up. My head throbbed and I could feel the dried cracked blood on the back of my neck. Why was I still alive? I thought desperately. And where was I? I tried to rise, and felt a reeling in my head, and a dull pain through my body. I sat into a fetal position and had a look at my surroundings. I was in some kind of a barn it looked. The room was small and dark, furnished with nothing but a cold stone floor, some dry pieces of hay and a shivering candle. The one lone door was heavy oak, and had been most likely locked. Sure enough, as I rose slowly and walked stiffly over to it, I was unable to open it. I looked over to the candle, and my first thought of burning the house down came to mind. Good idea Meredith, I muttered. Never smart to burn a house down while you're locked inside. I looked all around the room in vain, trying to find a means of escaping before my captors came back. I sat down against one of the cold slabs of wall and sighed. A beetle scuttled in front of me. I eyed it, and my mouth began to salivate. A hand shot of, crushing the beetle in it's grasp, juice oozed out of it's decaying palm. The hand rose to my mouth, and I realized it was own. I swallowed the beatle ravenously, smacking my lips. My mind began to work faster, the room began to spin. Click, click, click- little pictures of what had happened began to form in my mind. My body seperated from my mind, both reeling and lurching with new rythyms and motion. Inside I was screaming, outside I was a beast. They had blood- induced me, Lily herself smiling broadly eyes blank and round like those of a great white shark. She had taken me as her prize, her toy. I was half awake when she pulled me to her. Her body was dead and rotten, chunks of flesh had dropped off, leaving molding pieces of bones and muscles filled with maggots. She pulled my face to hers and kissed me lightly on the cheek, her lips dry and cracked with blood. I pulled at her hair and her face in vain attempts to get away, but she just laughed darkly as her cold hands gripped my tighter. Her lips left a trail down my cheek, towards my neck. I felt her sharp fangs plunge into a big, fat juicy vein and for a brief spasm I shook with pain. My body crumpled after that, and I fell asleep- only to be thrown into this cell. It was complete I thought bitterly, as I snapped out of my reverie. I sat there, calmly watching my body lurch and grovel around the small barn, reeling and banging itself against the walls. I wanted meat, and blood and pain. I wanted to cause pain, and feel hurt seep within my pores. I knew it wasnt right, but then a deep laughter filled the tiny room. Maniac laughter that sputtered and kicked and growled. I looked around the room in surprise, only to find the laughter coming from deep within my soul...The monster had been born.	f

"Very strange night.. had a great time in Chicago Rock and Liquid, then went down to the Weighbridge for a taxi. Too very drunk young Scottish girls approached me...   ""Wherz are youz goin', wez should share a taxi!"" they were pretty cute, so I thought.. yeah, fuck it.. so the first one got dropped off around the corner and they spent about ten minutes saying a very emotional goodbye. (""I fucken lovez yooooou! uzz a babe alroght?"" ""I lovez you more yoooou!"")  So then it's just me and this little Scottish brunette, heading around to hers. We start talking about chill-out music and I say I like Morcheeba a lot, and she says she has the CD and would Iike to come in for a drink and listen to it.... so i say yes.. we arrive at her place. She is lodger with an older guy. The place is a bomb site, wallpaper peeling off the walls and a serious damp problem. It's like Laurence Llewyn-Bowen's worst nightmare. Except the guy is obviously in IT as he has a computer rig worth about 3k, and about 10k worth of home cinema gear. Weird.  So I get a cup of tea and sit down, while the girly sticks on the Morcheeba CD. She is tweaking various buttons on the amp to get the sound on, then she passes straight out, hitting the deck with a thud.  I sit there for a few seconds, not completely sure what to do. I utter a rather pathetic.. ""Umm... hello?"" and she doesn't move. I go over and check her pulse, breathing etc.. then put her in the recovery position and walk back home. I sure do pick 'em.  Please check out my new poll, I am giving you, our beloved readers, a chance to influence my love life."	m

"I'm leaving for Boston in 2.5 days.  B and I had a wonderful time during his visit to Sac the past 3 days.  We went to the mall (I got my first bikini), saw Spiderman 2, had dinner at Elephant Bar, went to Todai with M  D, spent time with his PoPo over lunch and at the Asian market, went out to dim sum with his aunts and uncle, and took a walk together.  I felt like we were constantly eating the whole weekend!  Besides my stomach, my heart is full as well.  I had a good time with him.  I'm discovering some ""boy habits"" that gross me out sometimes like popping zits and blisters, and picking his teeth at the table w/o a toothpick.  That's about it.  Those things I can live with, though.  It probably grosses me out because I'm not used to these boy habits and all boys gross me out to some degree.  Mostly, though, my heart feels heavy.  I love spending time with him, but i have guilt that spoils our time together.  Brandon and I slep together for the first time during his time here.  We had said when we first started dating that we would break up if we ever slept together and now we are facing that deciison.  I brought it up last night after he got back to Tigard.  He didn't seem to be feeling the same kind of guilt as I was, but I guess he hasn't really had time to think about it yet.  I can't bear the thought of not being with him.  I can't imagine us being in Boston together and just being ""friends"".  I think that would break my heart. I feel pressed by guilt over what we have done and the fear of getting pregnant. I plan on calling the peer counselors tomorrow about whether I should take a ""morning after pill"" and about birth control options.  But would getting birth control be like giving ourselves permission to have sex?  but knowing how we are together, if I spend time with him alone in his room, history shows that we are likely to get ourselves into trouble.  But why do I fear pregnancy more than I fear God?  I guess right now pregnancy seems like more of a real threat to me. Not that God should be a threat--I should say that I fear the consequences of pregnancy more than I fear God's judgement.  If it's pregnancy that I fear, then putting myself on birth control will eliminate that fear.  But if it's God that I fear, that will eliminate the sex (spiritual birth control).  So in a way, whether or not to start the Pill is like choosing who will be my master.  Choose the pill and sex will be my motivating factor.   I guess that leaves us with the decision of ""what next""? We talked last night about following through with our committment to break up if we slept together.  It seemed like B was prepared and willing to go through with it if I throught that was best.  He was concerned with my level of guilt and was very considerate of what I wanted to do.  He didn't try to convince me to think one way or another.  Neither of us had any answers, and that's where things stand now.  The only thing that both of us knows for sure is that we like eachother and want to be together.  It seems like the only thing that would keep us from having sex would be to break up--but neither of us want to do that.  I really want the decision of whether or not to be on birth control to be a decision that  both  of us make.  I wish he were here to attend the counseling class together."	f
"Yesterday was such fun!   Marina and I found out via the web that club lucy is postponed until a new place for it can be found.  (I guess they finally realized how shady The Webster is)  I was searching for a lesbian club so Rina and I could have our monthly dose of estrogen loving estrogen, when I found out that providence r.i. was having ""Pride"" that very day.  We drove there randomly and spent the day checking out booths of gay stuff, then at night there was a gay parade (complete with glow sticks, whistles and tamborines), and then at night we went to Devilles, an all women club with style- two patios, pool tables, a picnic (hot doggies and hamburgs)... It was ridiculously fun.  We met the desendent of an African prince and she chatted with us for much of the night.  We danced, we laughed, I ate a hamburger.  All and all, it was a blast.  Then on the way home we got lost because r.i. loves to trick you with their street signs.  It took forever to drive home and because Marina managed to stay awake and get us home, she is my hero!  Today is fathers day!  Happy day pops!"	f

"Ok, so I've heard (or been pitched) a lot of ""ideas"" to get rich, or have a business on the internet.  Some were good ideas, some were bad ideas.  I usually just try to be encouraging of my friends, knowing their ideas will be a lot of work with little or no return.  Moreover, a lot of people have become millionaires on the internet, some with really brilliant ideas, some with really stupid ones, and most by just selling porn.  Not that long ago I was walking past a homeless guy on the street (I'm in NYC) and I put a quarter in his coffee cup, and started thinking to myself ""hey, if that guy got a quarter from 4,000 people, he'd have $1,000.  4,000 people isn't a lot in NYC, a quarter isn't a lot of money to most people, and $1,000 is a fortune to a homeless guy.  So I started thinking...  What if I put up a website as an experiment, to see if it's possible to use very common internet tools like blogger.com and paypal, to become a millionaire a quarter at a time.  Have I thought this through?  Not as well as I should of I'm sure.  Anyway I figure I'll kick it off and see what happens...  So here's the idea.  It's just a quarter.  Most everybody can spare a quarter.  Send me a quarter.  You can use paypal by clicking on the quarter on the right side of the page.  Just a quarter, and if you feel like it your name, what town your from, what you think of my idea, I dunno, whatever you want to say.  I'll post every few days and try to mention all the people who sent me a quarter.  You know, ""John from St. Louis, MO sent in his quarter and said 'your idea was so dumb, I had to send a quarter!'""  On the days I don't get any quarters, I'll just post whatever I feel like, it's a blog after all.  And if you don't want to send me a quarter, but want to send me your thoughts, click the comments button at the bottom of the post, and then click Post a Comment.  I want to hear from you...  Can I do it?  Can I become a millionaire a quarter at a time?  I doubt it, but we'll see.  And there's no gimmick to this, it's not a scam.  Just a stupid idea I had, but I hope it works...  MC"	m

"I find the following subject a fascinating dimension of thinking and reflecting on Church and mission in a 21st century Aotearoa New Zealand contextwhat are Christian authentic communities? Where do they live out their communal existence? How do they live that existence out in terms of the missional challenge of the gospel? And, how do they contextualise and communicate that gospel? New Zealand is a mission field with very real challenges for Jesus-followers. Both challenging and exciting!   ""Ah, who will ever count the centuries examined in the margins of our books?   This is a quote from the Jewish poet/writer, Edmond Jabes, and it forms the central inspiration of my book,  urlLink  Living in the Margins   (appears to be out of print).    To live in the margins of tradition is to live in a vital space of interpretive activity that keeps the ""book"" living, growing, expanding with new commentary and enlivening questions. Many small Christian communities occupy this marginal space, living on the edge of tradition -- in the margins -- attending both to the claims of the tradition to which they belong and to the claims of new, unexpected situations. In a sense, marginal Christian communities are both ""inside"" the book and ""outside"" the book, with the margins of interpretation mediating between these two spaces   Terry A. Veling (Aussies and Kiwis will find an essay distillation of the above book in his essay  Margin Writing and Marginal Communities: Between Belonging and Non-Belonging  Published in  urlLink  Pacifica   9 / February 1996.)  Not an easy read, but who knows who reads this, and what they like reading, so, for an on-line example of his writing see: "" urlLink  Levinas and the Other Side of Theology  ."" He has some good things to say.  (In academic circles,  urlLink  Emmanuel Levinas   (1906-1995) is recognised as one of the most important philosophers and religious thinkers of this century. His work has significantly influenced many ""postmodern"" thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Maurice Blanchot, Luce Irigaray, Paul Ricoeur. He has also influenced Jewish and Christian leaders and educators, including Pope John Paul II. However, his  thinking is not generally well known to a broader audience.)"	m

And the trumpets blow... or maybe not.  However, there is a soaring in my heart that I have missed.  I have been working now for two weeks.  It's a good feeling.  Granted, it is only part time, but another job is possibly landing at my feet, too.  I couldn't truly be happier.  Well, that's not entirely true, but I feel so much better than when I started here.    Now, I don't know if the rest of you would like an explanation for the invitation that you received for Michael's beheading.  I have not lost my mind.  I will say that I am done with his games.  Unfortunately, there is still love for him in my heart.  I know, strangle me, but that doesn't go away overnight.  He pissed me off none-the-less.  I am clear-headed enough now to know when enough is rightly enough.  I cannot and will not take any more emotional beatings from him.  That is why I left my husband.  I deserve better than that and will accept nothing less than what I deserve.  He has not chosen to speak to me, yet, and when we finally do, it will most likely be goodbye.  It is a sadness everyone deals with many times in their lives.    Moving on...friend's are slowly multiplying and that makes me happy.  Liz is a kindred heart.  I am protective of her just as I am of Mel.  Perhaps more so because I sense a fragility in her, yet.  She has more rebuilding to do than I did.  Melanie helped me with mine.  I hope I will be of service to Liz.  She is strong.  She knows what needs to be done, it's just doing it that scares her.    Well, off I go to reign over my small kingdom... Peace to you all.	f

"It's official- Ms. Welch is an evil bitch.  I explained it in an e-mail I sent to my parents:  ""Just to let you know, if my grade isn’t very good in English this 6-weeks, thank Ms. Welch- she made us fail a test because she made us do it over a book we hadn’t been assigned to read.  We came into class today, and she said “We’re doing a test over the 14 chapters you were supposed to read by today” and NOBODY knew what she was talking about. She said “well I told you last time I was here! The sub gave you an assignment!”  The truth was, the last time she was here, all she said was “We’re going to watch a movie today because you guys are probably sick of English right now.”  She said nothing about reading a book, she said we were going to read it in class. The sub on Friday that we had actually said “She didn’t leave me anything to do, so basically I’m your ‘free-time director’.”  Just letting you know.   Reminder: Please don't forward this to Ms. Welch, if she doesn't remember that she didnt tell us to do anything, she will definitley not be happy with me stating her faults.""  It's all true.  I actually had a GOOD christian-athiest conversation with someone the other day, and- get this- they didn't hide from behind aim! That's so cool!  It was with this girl named Denebra(i think thats how its spelled), who I originally thought wasn't the smartest person, was actually able to keep up with my athiesm arguement for more than 2 seconds and flinching out with ""I'm christian, i'm not comfortable about talking about that."" Props to her.  I walked by these 2 girls talking yesterday, and one of them said ""Well, I wanna have kids, but I don't wanna get married.""  *sigh* She was mexican, too.

[15488]  Today I went out to find a nice suit to wear for my cousin's wedding next week. One of the things I hate most is shopping for clothes. I don't mind when I've gone shopping with ex girlfriends or even when I accidentally get dragged into by female friends. However, when I have to do it myself... it just makes me feel fucking uncomfortable.  Here are some reasons why: 1) Realizing that I too am materialistic and superficial. Clothing is and has been one of the most basic things that delineate social class. Like Roman robes! I'm buying into the motherfucking capitalist system! Shit I even looked around South Coast Plaza for something! 2) Dealing with sales people. Fuck I want them to just leave me alone. 3) The time consuming aspect of finding something that fits and looks good. The thing with nice clothes is that they have to fit to look good. The biggest problem with my build is that I have pretty wide shoulders given the build of the rest of my body.  When I was going through suits it took forever to find something that fit me decently. 4) Spending money on something superfluous. 5) Parking at malls suck. Anyway.. I have a nice new suit after hours of work. I don't feel fulfilled though.  I should perhaps nap for a while.  **	m

Well I suppose, seeing as I am knee-deep in dead people, that I am doing pretty well.  my grandmother's brother's wife's father and my great-aunt have, in the span of a week, both died. I suppose I ought to be a bit upset, but I'm just not feeling it. I didn't know either of these people and I don't think death is something to be mourned anyhow.   Friday... A very good day. Around midnight me, Devon, mom, and Lauren struck out and went to waffle house and wal-mart. We bought some duct tape and I got a whole bunch of my absolute favorite t-shirts: Hanes tagless stain-guard tees. I LOVE them. Came home, chilled and made duct tape purses.   Saturday... Got into some more juniper berries and felt awful((roasted brazilian snapper with buerre blanc sauce and spinach salad))((they were in the form of capers this time, and I didn't realize!)), but babysat anyways. JUST when I was pondering the idea of children and how they may not be so bad, this happens. I don't know why the little monsters were so awful, but...Yeah. Running around, screaming, punching, locking eachother in the dog kennel, hell.  Sunday...Messed around.  Monday...Swam all morning, felt shitty all day, don't know what's wrong with me. I suppose I feel sort of bad for not going to the grandmother's brother's wife's dad's funeral, and making mammaw go by herself.	f

Another great avenue to use in your research is locally and/or nationally held festivals. The place to go to find out about dates, times and events is your local Chamber of Commerce. They will have any and all the information you need about local festivals. Usually, while at the local festivals you can catch wind of upcoming national festivals.   The festivals are also an excellent place to make new connections with others who are also doing genealogy research. The more people you have to work with the more information you will find! Who knows, you may even meet a relative you didn't know that you had!  I do know ofone festival that is held everysecond weekend in June and that is the Cesky Den Festival in Hillsboro, WI. This festival is a 100% Bohemian/Czech festival, full of good ol' Bohemian food, music, dancing and for those who still speak the old language, Bohemian story telling. I unfortunately have never been able to attend the festival due to work scheduling conflicts, but I plan on being there next June! My father has gone and he was amazed and astonished at everything the festival had to offer--and low and behold, he did get to meet a relative that we didn't know about! The Cesky Den Festival has a website and I have it listed here  urlLink www.ceskyden.com .--be sure to go and czech it out! (Sorry for the pun--I couldn't resist!)  Remember, each avenue provides you opportunities to find out more about your family and your culture--take advantage of them whenever you can because you don't know when they will disappear.	f

ok, so i received an email today that a niece of ecw had a baby yesterday weighing over 10 pounds .......whup is the only response......we did not know they were expecting...despite multiple funerals last year when every one gathered and caught up on news........we are excited for any couple going for a third child...we think it is the child that will certanily drive you mad..the first is practice, the second is a piece of cake and the third is sheer craziness........the good news is that the baby was big, which means that she ate well......a business aquaintance recently divulged that he had had a vacectomy, at the age of 47+....he wanted praise, but i was aghast that he had waited all of this time.......his children are both over 17..for god's sakes.......what took him so long......my in-laws were catholic  and it was the potential for new babies that drove them to separate beds long before desire faded...i hope that my children are responsible with birth control, and do not rely on prayers to limit family size..........	f
ERIN!!! Soup diets are for retards... don't you see that?  You are not a retard so get off the stupid soup diet.  All a soup diet does is make you unhappy.  You are always hungry (thus unhappy),  have no energy (thus unhappy), and you loose weight at such an underwhelming pace that you think you aren't loosing weight (thus making you unhappy) and then you get unhappy cuz' you realize that you are so unhappy all the time and the stupid diet isn't working anyway and what a fucking waste of time.  And what if you do happen to loose a few kilos??? You start eating again and re-gain the weight really quickly because your body is still the unremarkable food processor it always was, and it will always be unless you start to excercise.   And by the way Erin, excercise is not a slow walk around Hyde Park with Bec and a beer once a week.  You don't need to starve yourself to be happy, just eat a little different and except that you don't really look bad at all.  Food for thought (no pun intended).  Nuff said	f
Everyone in this part of the world is focused on the UT-OU game. Last I checked, OU was whooping some UT horns. I could really give a flying *aggie sign* about college football, NFL is where it's at. It's funny that I feel the exact opposite in regards to basketball. Pro is way to individual-oriented, too much offence no defense, no plays run at all, unless you count the well-paid/under grand jury investigation tall guy getting the ball and jumping from impossibly far out to dunk it a play. This last year I had the amazing experience of attending the Final Four in person. Wow. This year, the Super Bowl is in Houston. Attending it would be the perfect one-two punch for my career as an avid sports fan. Maybe followed by a writing contract with NFL.com or ESPN. I could replace Rush! I promise to yell no profanely racist comments and to actually listen and to... wait, the only women the NFL hires are weather sluts or sideline bimbos. Still, I love the game.  I know I've been out of the action for two weekends due to traveling, but I'm back and Sunday is upon us.  urlLink King Kaufman  is definitely on his game in his column, in which he makes witty little comments about stupid kickers not avoiding Dante Hall. If you go to Salon to check him out, stay for the  urlLink Anne Lemott article . I think it's hilarious that Arnold makes Anne stir inside real deep! As always, let me know if you need help cracking your way into Salon's articles.   Each week I am amazed at the filming by  urlLink HBO's Inside the NFL . Since the season began (this is my first season to have HBO, for those of you lucky ducks who are like, we learned this last year!), I keep thinking it can't get any better. But it does! If you don't have HBO, it's like the filming on the feature link historic game overviews you see on ESPN all the time, or on network around the Super Bowl. Only, it's not about some boring game played before I was born, it's now! They set up sideline cameras that keep up with Ricky Williams making an amazing breakaway, meanwhile playing the sound from the mic'ed up ref or linebacker. I honest to God felt I was there. I have yet to be sold on their newhires, but I'll give them a chance. The episode from two weeks ago is my favorite. This puny lawyer for  urlLink Maurice Clarett  got cheeky with  urlLink Cris Carter , I thought he was going to lose his head!  Speaking of  urlLink Ricky , he's writing again and things are good in runrickyrun land. He says things don't get much better than this, presumably speaking of being the star player on a team that is Super Bowl material. I got a very nice compliment this week when a friend said if they were reincarnated any time soon they hoped to be the third Feighery child. Well, I'll pass this buck along and say I want to be Ricky Williams! Or Brian Urlacher. Ooh, too tough to call. I can't dis my New Mexico boy.   Ok, enough talk. Tomorrow the Texans simply must beat the Titans. Last year was amazing with the Dallas win right off the bat, but was hampered by the absence of a Titan pounding. The year I moved to Houston, everyone had bumper stickers that read Go Oilers! Take the Astros With You! This was the year the turncoat Oilers decided to move to Tennessee and became the Titans. The Bears must also win because everyone thinks it's a fluke that they beat Oakland last week. The only time the Saints came out to play this year was against Houston, so they just can't have two out of my three teams.   So in summary, go Bears, run Ricky, pound 'em, Texans, and don't kick to Dante Hall. Kickoff's at noon, see you tomorrow! Cheers!	f
"So here I am work, wanting so bad for it to be 5:00 so that I can go home. I usually don't get off until 6, but I had to come in early today to cover for someone else who isn't here.  I am sooooo tired I can barely stay awake!! Bubbs and I were up pretty late talking about ""us"" and how all of this hurts me so much. And then I couldn't fall asleep until about 4:30am. My heart was beating so fast, I have no idea why?? Whatever. I want to leave work to go home, but don't want to because my dad will be there and he has been such a bug lately. Where's this, where's that? What are you doing? .....It is like being a defendent in a courtroom! Urg it bothers me!! Well I guess I better get back to my job, more typing!"	f
"I am up awfully late. Dang awful late. I got up at 8am this morning to go to a breakfast meeting only to realise once I got there it was actually next Saturday. It is normally every second Saturday of the month and as this month the second Saturday occurs at the latest date possible, I naturally got things mixed up. Well that is my excuse and I am sticking to it. Heh.  So I dragged my weary sleep deprived body home and went straight back to bed (it is a Saturday, I am not going to be up if I don't have to). Then I promptly went to sleep. And I promptly woke up at 6:00 PM.  Aye curumba!  Talk about wasting a day. I'd figure that at worst I would sleep until 1:00 PM.  Well (alot of) sleep has helped dull the anger I was feeling yesterday. I was so ready for out-right revenge, only a few pegs sort of postal. But today I finally realise the meaning of the saying ""revenge is a dish best served cold"". 'Cold' I now know has nothing to do with temperature of refridgeration, but hard, logical calculation and well thought out ideas.  Actually that sounds rather menacing. Heck, I properly will do nothing more then complain to (the correct) people. But I can have my moments of grand illusions thinking I will do somethign on the level of a melodramatic soap-opera. Heck I want my damn melodramatic soap-opera. I earnt it!  Plus I have been listening to ""Into The Woods"" non-stop. Stephen Sondheim is a God. Odd though since my music taste tends to be pretty hard-core (think Punk/alt-Rock with some 80s guitar rifts thrown in), but that upbeat, funny, hilarious broadway soundtrack is definately a good thing to perked me up. Heck I am feeling perkier at the moment then Pamela Anderson after a cold shower."	m

Hurt? Worried? Perhaps this is the price to pay for loving him. Forget it. Don't wait for the disastrous reply. It's all his fault. Ignore him. I've decided to take a long vacation from love and relationships. Say no more, fear no more. I've a secret thought in my heart. I do not care. I do not care no more. I do not care if my heart still loves him or not. No matter what he says or how he questions, no way will he know about my future plans. Don't be silly. Don't be fake. Even if he is no longer my love story. Don't love me, leave me. Because I've found a way to be happy. I'll sing, I'll dance and let you vanish from my world. I'll forget you. Goodbye. I won't believe in the novelty of love. I'll run away, just let me run away. I'll wonder why, wonder why love has no logic. Forget it, ignore him, don't look at him. I can fly freely.  Who says I will never smile again? Who says I cannot live a better life?  I'll fly away.	f

72 hours, 72 beers. Coincidence?  ... Or: 18 hours sober now. And not by choice.  My statement from the first was prophetic. I can hardly remember any of my weekend. That is thanks to a 12-pack of Miller Lite, a 30-pack of Pabst, and a 30-pack of Old Style. Let it be noted that I did not drink all 72 by myself. If I had I would be A) dead and 2) as great as I think I am. Also I'm not counting the drinks from the record release party we went to. Let's just say we had a few. A few being more than two by a bunch.  We got into town about midnight on thursday and stayed up til 5 drinking. Slept most of the day on the 4th went to a bar-b-q and then the previously mentioned party and then stayed up on my friend's roof until the sun started coming up. I'm sure the  neighbors loved us. More of the same on Saturday.  The only draw back to the trip was that we had let a bunch of other people know we were going to be down for the weekend. It's kind of hard to make it to lunch when you're passed out drunk. Y'know, I think that qualifies me for an intervention. Missing appointments and what not. And we had called a lot of people too. So we're sorry and we're giving up drinking (water).  Well, I'll be back in the city next month. You hear that Chicago? I'll be back for round three!  More on this trip as pictures get developed. Oh, boy...	m

"Nothing out of the ordinary until later on at night today.  Tyke woke up at about, oh, noon, and after that he went upstairs and his bro was home talking with his mom and then they talked about his trip cross country to D.C. for law school.  He is driving himself all the way across the country and keeping his car there so he has to move everything.  It's going to be interesting.  He leaves on Saturday.  One week from today.  So Tyke is pretty soon going to be even more of an only child, even if he is going to be at Pullman anyway.  That will be quite a trip though.  Driving all the way across the country by himself.  Gotta admire that go-getterness.  After talking about that trip they talked about Tyke's college plans and his schedule.  They looked at possible changes to his schedule like trying to put in Com101 cuz that will be his major but it really doesn't work out.  Tyke should have a pretty easy time though.  But his second semester might be pretty hard.  It will probably be 16 or 17 credits as opposed to 14.  And right now two of the classes Tyke is taking he has pretty much taken before so hopefully that will mean he can really have a high GPA and excel early on cuz it is a cutthroat college of communications he wants to be a part of and to get in he has to be good.  Well after his brother left Tyke played some Hoyle Casino 2004 and he lost a lot of money.  He lost most of it on the horses though.  Damn that Purple Prancer.  Lost Tyke about $8000.  That should have been an omen for the night but Tyke didn't take it as one.  His parents left at 5 something to go to a friends' house for the night so Tyke went to Teriyaki Bistro for dinner and coincidentally ran into Dr. Phil there.  He was with his Cali friends and Amed was there earlier too.  After a little while they got a poker game going at Dr. Phil's house with Amed, the Cali boys, DCups, Macaroon, and Dr. Phil's dad.  It was a pretty damn big pot tonight.  $230 when Tyke left.  Tyke started off getting crap for a long time.  He spotted DCups 10 bucks and later got that paid back but Tyke still ended up being in 30 when it was all said and done.  He was even up for a little while thanks heavily to Dr. Phil's dad but that ended up going down the crapper.  A tough hand with QQ and A10 and then right after A10 Tyke got AJ and ended up getting outdrawn by Dr. Phil to take him out.  Tyke was pretty mad when he was out.  He usually doesn't get mad losing money but this is the most he's ever lost and he didn't lose it in ways he liked.  It just put him in a bad mood.  Listening to DC on the way home couldn't even make it a sad mood.  Instead it remained a bad mood and then when he got home it went away when he told his parents about the game.  First thing his mom said, ""230 dollars?!?!?!?!?""  Yes, mom but I lost 30.  Tyke told his dad about how DCups got both quad Js and a straight flush off the flop in 2 of his hands.  And there was another hand with quad 5s later.  Then some full houses too.  It was just a big night really.  Tyke really wanted to win some money but he didn't.  When he got home though he took a 20 that his parents owed him but Tyke just decided he would leave it until now.  So he only lost 10 tonight and DCups still owes him 10 too.  Tomorrow it looks like there might be a basketball game going on so Tyke will probably join that.  Other than that he has no plans so give him a call and set something up with him.  He'd love to join."	m
"Ok - let review...  According to my  urlLink last post , my schedule for today ( in italics ) was as follows:    9amish – 11ish  Mom is visiting and we’re going out to breakfast. That’s right… mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   That never happened. My aunt, who would have tagged along, had car trouble which translated to no visit from mom. It was disappointing but so be it. I'm sure she'll make it up some other time. And we at least got some phone shennanigans in leiu of a person to person visit. For now, I'm willing to be content with that.    11amish – 6pmish Parades! Parades! Parades!  What a whore I am… 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didn’t so desperately need the money I swear… though in all honesty I’d probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, I’m not above the BCB, baby. [fo’ shizzle]   Well now... here's how  that  dance of shame went down...  We met up at the good ol'  urlLink NEC  (standard) and headed off with absolutly  no idea  of how to get where we were going (also standard). After some slick maphandling skills on my part [translation: I found the town on the map - big accomplishment for me] we were headed west to the town of  urlLink Sudbury .  Despite the cops who, all of which, seemed to be entirely uninterested in giving us directions to either the start of the parade or a place where we could park, we found a place to seat Tom's oh so choice Volvo and we unloaded. 10 min later, freshly shirted, shod, and bearing instruments, we trucked over to meet the rest of the band.  It was hotter than a lesbian daisy chain outside. The sky was a hectic blue and the sun glared mercilessly down on our motley crew. Needless to say, after about 40 yards, we were panting and sweating. A lil' group of politically inclinded Sudburians saw our plight and offered us ice water. God Bless them. Soon after, the bands (Wooster Brass and Boston City) formed like Voltron and we set out for to make a spectacle of ourselves.  The parade, though long and brutally hot, was awesome. Every 5 yards, someone was offering us ice water. The crowd not only smiled and waved but cheered and clapped along to whatever we happened to be playing... including the cadance. Barbeques burned, cute children were in abundance, and we were encouraged onward by a sea of amiling faces. I've hardly ever seen a more appreciative crowd - never with the BCB.  Don't get me wrong now, kids. The parade was still a hellish nightmare festival (again, standard). However, Sudbury definitly made me feel appreciated.  Hail to thee, fair Sudbury!  The parade ended without much hullabaloo and, you guessed it, it was off to parade number two - this time in  urlLink Norwood . This one wasn't nearly as inviting as Sudbury.  The parade was set to begin at 4:30 which fit perfectly into my earlier made plans to hang out with Buck from about 6 on. When we got there, we found out the parade had been moved up an hour to 5:30. No Biggie. Then we waited around forever - well past 5:30. My plans with Chris (Buck) were shot to hell. Finally, after an eternity or two, we were on the parade route and doing our Boston City bestest to ""hype the crowd"". About midway through [stopped on the route - hindered by a troupe of gypsies - hand to god] our Tuba player somehow got a fan club. A bunch of [hopelessly adorable] kids came up and were standing off at a bit of a distance trying to figure out what the hell it was that he was carrying. He did a great thing... he scared the bejesus out of 'em by growling in a huge voice through the Sousaphone and chasing the little kids. It was wonderful. He played with these kids until it was time to move on. The kids were deliriously happy. The Tuba player earned a bit more of my respect. What a swell guy. We finished up the parade without incident and, after a few hangups (totaling a little more than an hour), we were on our way back to Boston. By now it was about 9:20 PM and I would have gotten back to Boston by around 9:45 had we not run across that damned Krispy Kreme.  It's even better than you can imagine.  We walked in, brought our instruments, played, and got 2 dozen doughnuts.   Free.   Clearly, no one can resist the power of the BCB. After that, it was off to home for me.   6pmish - whenever, baby Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget! [insert 80's power rock ballad here] Jillian's fits into our plans somewhere. Evening, thy name is Jackassery!   I was met by a calm and understanding Chris Buck on my stoop. I was more than 3 hours late and, though it had been out of my control, it still sucked hard. There was really only one option for us at this point.  We went to  urlLink Jillian's  - three stories of beer, pool, bowling [that's right] and a number of other fun things - and right next to  urlLink Fenway !. Jillian's is HUGE! Bigger than all the Uconn bars combined... easily... and on three floors, my friends. We ended our night with beer, chicken, and billards.  Good times.  Home was a short walk away. Just how short, you ask?    [note: if the image doesn't show, visit  urlLink http://www.frankpipe.com/fenwayjillian.jpg  to see what I'm talking about.]  Which brings me to now... tired yet content and staring down the barrel of another parade in the AM. Wish me luck, kids. For now, I'm heading to dreamland.   Zzz..."	m

"urlLink http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,10290030%5E2,00.html    Curse leaves Democrats red-faced   By Nick Buchan   July 30, 2004   AN on-air curse broadcast by CNN after US Presidential candidate John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech has left Democrats and network officials with red faces.  After Senator Kerry's speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, balloons and confetti were released into the crowd.   But apparently there weren't enough for DNC convention centre director Don Mischer, who was heard on voiceover urging workers to release more balloons and confetti.  'No confetti. No confetti yet. Go balloons. Go balloons. More balloons. All balloons. All balloons. Come on guys, let's move it,"" began a relatively calm Mr Mischer.  Soon afterward however the DNC director begam to panic.  ""Jesus, we need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, goddamn. No confetti. No confetti. No confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons.

"Where do I start?  I will try to be as honest as possible, maybe I even learn more about the Real Me.  I think I have to go back about a year, to right before I became a regular on the then free MsN Chatroom ""Books""...    It feels such a long time ago, I can't believe I've changed so much in just one year.  It makes me wonder who I will be this time next year?  But that's not the issue here, lets go back to the creation of Mr_Mortez, or as he became known fairly quickly... Horny_Morty.    I created my new Hotmail Account and wanted the name Oblivious, or Oblivion, which it turned out, was already taken.  So was every other name I tried.  I did not want to add strings of digits, that I was very persistent on, so I struggled for almost an hour until I could take it no longer.    I was working on about the 10th draft of ""The Life of Regor Mortez"" a story I started writing in grade 9 as a shortstory and just kept at it.  I figured if the name - which is somewhat of a pun on rigor mortis was already taken, then I had no originality in the story itself anyway.    So Mr_mortez looked for a chatroom, and when he innocently walzed into the ""Books"" chatroom hoping to find similarly minded people or maybe even editors...    Technically we're the same person.  Mr_Morty and Renier ""Potty"" Potgieter.  But not quite in spirit.  Anyone who has ever been in a chatroom might know what I'm talking about.  Its very easy to say what you want because you're perfectly safe behind your keyboard.      Except for hackers and policemen searching for pedophiles.    But Mr_Mortez got to insulting any clueless brainy reader who happened to be interrested in Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter (cheers).  And they weren't the only ones.      Quickly on the Harry Potter (cheers) issue, here's a quote from Igkuk7 on a footnote I should add actually more concerning an old friend he lost contact with... no questions asked.  His quotes would have it that I'm the person writing it... which I'm not.            Iain says: say something likie ""not five minutes would go by without someone birsting through the virtual door ranting and raving about harry potter, where upon several of the regulars would jump on then and literally knock the confidence out of them, Zennha, or heart_a_blaze being the best at this, although I never met her, I have a reliable source who tells me this is so. And no he wasn't drunk at the time of asking""      Exactly.  Now I didn't realize how an insult can go a long way until I met those more experienced at the trade than I was.  Like good ol' Jesusiscomingsoonsolookbusy.  An offensive name to fit to his character.  He was funny at times, but he and a couple of others could spoil the mood in the room in an instant.      So I turned my attentions rather from insults to making women feel good.  Complimenting them on their obvious good looks from the photo in their profile.  Even if they were as ugly as hell.    I had a lot of fun and nothing can replace old Books, and even if I did whip out the money to get membership, it won't be the same without the others.      Just to mention a couple, simply so I can lure them to look at my blog by saying ""Hey you're in it!""  Here goes in no particular order: DinoDreams, ProudestMonkey, Oracle, Darwin,  urlLink Igkuk7 , the Kiwicheeser, Donks, Archangel, Breezio,  urlLink Adrienne , Ashley, Jon, Boo, Digi, Luna, Lovely Leda, Talhawkins, Gill, Civ, Misty, Mystical... sheesh, the memories is making me all emotional.     There is one lady I didn't mention who might be quite upset if I left her out, but she only really came into the picture after MsN closed their freechat and all the regulars moved over to Yahoo.  No offense and I certainly don't want to step on any legal issues, but Yahoo people are weird.  Very.       Back to Books though.    If you wanted to have a good old chat about books, you should go to the library.  Books was the wrong chatroom.  If you wanted to talk about sex, life and various twisted philosophies, then sure, Books was the place.  On Wednesdays there was what could be best described as Lesbian Nite, which would usually result in me grabbing a virtual chair, pulling it right up to a virtual stage and get the wummen to illustrate how they are poledancing.    Leda was a very good poledancer.    Still is, probably.    I made a couple of very good frieds there, and although it might seem sad to anybody else, I wouldn't exchange those days for anything.      And then, in October MsN closed their freechat and everybody migrated to Yahoo Entertainment and Arts/ On Broadway, simply because it was always empty.  Until we migrated, apparently, because all of a sudden it was flooded with the weird people I mentioned earlier.      But this is where I met another MsN Books regular, she remembers me in Books, but I hit on so many women, she probably just dissapeared into a sea of nameless faces, especially since we only talked once or twice in there.    By this time in Yahoo I changed my nic to Horny_Morty, which was honest enough, and then to enter the scene and my life...  Kinky_Carly.  An amazing woman, we had such a lot in common it wasn't long before we got to the internet dating thing.  Naughty emails, marathon messanger sessions till 5am in the morning...    She is from Chile, sexy and as intelligent as they come.  I couldn't believe a woman as good as that could like me, so I took it as it came.  Ironically enough, the women I dated previously back in South Africa - always briefly - never made me feel like she did, I started to realize what type of woman I am compatible with, that a pretty face alone was not good enough.      We were together for 5 and a half months, and other than that, I'm not going to go into further detail about the actual relationship or the break-up, because it still hurts a little when I think about it.  But she changed me more than any other factor, I think, she made me realize what  matters .  She will always have a place in my heart even though its over between us, the hot numbing feeling in my stomach when I think about her has faded.      She might have another boyfriend, I never even met her in person, but she'll always stay that Kinky_Carly, and I'll remember her with fondness.    While I knew her I had this big fight to get a Working Holiday Visa for the United Kingdom, which was denied the first time and accepted on my appeal.  Throuhgout that time there were ups and downs as I had a date in mind.    The month of July.    The delay caused by the refusal of the Visa was a big blow at the time, because I would have been able to visit Chile and meet my dream woman.  Now July is here and I know it would not have worked out that way, but I still wish I could get very drunk and sleep through the whole month - just to get past what could have been.      Arg, enough moaning.      But meeting Carly had been what has changed me to the person I am today, accepting that a loudmouth Horny_Morty was a waste of my time, first and foremost.  I'm better off with being myself, and its ironic how the old people are right time and time again?    My father always told me to be myself, and it took me all this time to discover it all over again.    I do have a further love interrest, and I'm going to put my money on the fact that I'll be a changed man this time next year... I hope its for the better.    I wrote this all in one session, so I'll update it as i go along and get a better perspective on what I wrote.    All for now  Slightly_Potty  To  urlLink My Writing Interrests"	m

"First week after winter break is finaly over. Man this week owned so much. Let's say what happened  Monday - For us in the PPS school district, we had school :(. It was good to get back into some of my classes for a bit. CST was fun because i was ahead of everyone. I got a 87% on my big ass CST quarter 2 test. In english i didnt really do anything. Math, we went over our class test. Lunch, mr melton wasnt there so we didnth have a meeting. Spanish we had new seats and did some class work, History we just sat around and read out of the book. That was it  Tuesday - Someone answered my prayers and brought the PPS district a snow day!!!! That was awesome. I mainly just sat around and home and played games  Wednesday- Someone answered my prayers again and brought us ANOTHER snow day. This time my friend Ryder came over and we did some stuff at my house.  Thursday - SOMEONE ANSWERED MY PRAYERS AGAIN!!!!! ANOTHER SNOW DAY!!!! Man this was cool. This time i went over to ryders house, listened to some Queen ""Best band ever"", and i helped him with SC. Then we walked all the way from his house up to Subway and had some sandwiches. Man, subway = WIN. Then we went back to my house and played some Diablo 2.  Friday - Holy shit, could it get any better? ANOTHER SNOW DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Basicaly today i went to kaiser to get some medication for this damn skin condition i have. Grrrr, then we went to the PC club to check on my RAM to see if i can use it yet. They still dont have the mother board to test it with!!! Damnit i need that RAM. So far that's all that's happened during this first week of 2004. I hope there's more kick ass weeks to come, this year owns so far."	m
Oh my how trite, but i could not resist. Life has calmed a lot. No longer running around frantically from homework to show to bar to homework. I miss it. Now i am reclining on the couch and becoming better aqainted with the ass groove in the loveseat while i watch too much television and lament the weather and my wilting social life. The shins sucked, went to go see them on friday, but they stopped taking comps whilst we were in line, it was ass crowded with junior high bobbysoxers on the first floor, and with twentysomthing hipsters(who were remarkably attractive in the main) on the mezzaine. I immediatly felt that i was going to sick up, from the crowd, the haze of ciggarett smoke, the half bottle of wine and three hal drink i had had earlier, and, no doubt, from the stench of unwashed preteen rising towards me. The sound was awfull and we left after four or five songs and watched charlies angels two instead. Saturday i met jannie and my aunt and two small cousins downtown to look at marshall feilds eighth floo(washed out colors and weak imagery) and than wander through the skyways looking at everything. I have had better times, but it was nice to see them nonetheless. yesterday i just read and cleaned, read and cleaned. cheers	m

Dear All,  Very good reading on existence of god. Read it at leisure.  Cheers,  urlLink Vijay Bhatter     An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his class on the problem,science has with Krishna. He asks one of his new students to stand and.....   Professor:  You are a Hare Krishna devotee, aren't you, son?   Student:  Yes, sir.   Prof:  So you believe in God?   Student:  Absolutely, sir.   Prof:  Is God good?   Student:  Sure.   Prof:  Is God all-powerful?   Student:  Yes.   Prof:  My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to Krishna to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But Krishna didn't. How is this Krishna good then? Hmm? (The student is silent.)   Prof:  You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fellow. Is God good?   Student:  Yes.   Prof:  Is Satan good?   Student:  No.   Prof:  Where does Satan come from?   Student:  From...God...   Prof:  That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?   Student:  Yes.   Prof:  Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything. Correct?    Student:  Yes.   Prof:  So who created evil?(The student does not answer.)   Prof:  Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness?.All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they?   Student:  Yes, sir.   Prof:  So, who created them?(The student has no answer.)   Prof:  Tell me, son. Do you believe in Krishna?   Student:  Yes, professor, I do.   Prof:  Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Krishna?   Student:  No, sir.   Prof:  Tell us if you have ever heard your Krishna?   Student:  No, sir.   Prof:  Have you ever felt your Krishna, tasted your Krishna, smelt your Krishna? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Krishna or God for that matter?   Student:  No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.   Prof:  Yet you still believe in Him?   Student:  Yes.   Prof:  According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your Krishna doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?   Student:  Nothing. I only have my faith.   Prof:  Yes. Faith. And that is the problem science has.   Student:  Professor, is there such a thing as heat?   Prof:  Yes.   Student:  And is there such a thing as cold?   Prof:  Yes.   Student:  No sir. There isn't.(The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.)   Student:  Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat,mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 273 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it. (There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.)   Student:  What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?   Prof:  Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness?    Student:  You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something.You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light.....But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?   Prof:  So what is the point you are making, young man?   Student:  Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.   Prof:  Flawed? Can you explain how?   Student:  Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?   Prof:  If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.   Student:  Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir? (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.)   Student:  Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher? (The class is in uproar.)   Student:  Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor's brain?(The class breaks out into laughter.)   Student:  Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it?.....No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?  (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.)   Prof:  I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son.   Student:  That is it sir.. The link between man  god is FAITH. That is all that keeps things moving  alive.   Contributed by   Shrikanth G Hampiholi  .	m

"I woke up this morning...I mean this afternoon at 11:30am. I got up and took a shower, got ready, and on my way downstairs I slipped and landed on my right foot. It was a nasty fall at the top of the stairs. I had one of those seconds in my head that last forever: I imagined rolling all the way down the staircase and either becoming dead or having to be rushed to the hospital. Of course it is just a sprained foot, but lots more happened in my head and it was really scary. Needless to say my foot hurts like a (you fill in this blank) and my theatre rehearsal this evening was really hard and painful.   Now that I think back, it must not have been too hard because after rehearsal I went to Sharkey's and then to La Rue with Jolly. It was �dollar drink night� at La Rue. I ran into some friends I haven�t seen in a while; Sean, Qumar and Brent. Before that, at Sharkey's, my ex Jonathan happens to show up with his girlfriend. It became one of those ""let�s conveniently not see each other so we won�t have to have any awkward conversation"" situations. Oh well.  I have had a spot of sunshine in my unemployed car-less existence. His name is  urlLink Sevag.  My connection with Sevag is a really long story�and I am hoping that it will have a great ending. I will keep you informed.  It is almost 2am and I think I will actually be heading off to bed. Traci? Bed? I know it is odd, but get used to it, I have. I love all of you that read this.

Wooooooo! Discussion! People blogging! Wooooo!!!  Well I'll admitit, at teh begining of the year I really didn't mind Joe putting his CD's on, i didn't mind listening to kiss all day. I admit some of the songs were good. Even got my feet tapping away but now I'm totally against it all mainly because of the way its been handled. I wouldn't mind Joe putting his CD's on if he asked everyone first 'Does anyone mind if I change the CD?' or if he waited for the actual CD to finish but he doesn't. He just goes and turns it off whenever he pleases, like its HIS stereo and it isn't. Its everyones. I know poeple have different tastes, lok at my CD collection. I own a bit of everything. Pop, Rock, RnB, Soundtracks, Jazz atc... I don't mind what we listen to I just wish it was dealt with in a better way. But I agree, the best solutionis simply no stereo at all. When they took it away for a week the common room was so much better. You could hear yourself think, you could have conversation with people without shouting and no one got wound up for people changing the CD or radio station. Yes, I vote too,  Get rid of the CD player . If people want to listen to stuff they can bring in their own personal stereos.  I saw the drama plays last night. WOW. I am so proud of everyone who was in them :) Only thing that annoyed me slightly was that they decided to tell me as we were all leaving that I was invited to Pizza Express with them as the drama group were going. Grrr. Tell me a few days before and I can get money. Tell me five minutes before and gah. Ah well. That doesn't matter anyway, the plays were sooo good and I would say more but I have to go to work so byeee.	m

Dawn has a great  urlLink entry  today about an event she attended yesterday.    The event was a panel discussion on love sponsored by  The Week  and featured as one of the speakers, Farrah Fawcett.  Dawn writes that this was a special gift for her  year old self who desired to look like Farrah Fawcett when she grew up.  I was also invited to this event by publicist Matthew Caldecutt, but unfortunately, due to my work schedule I was unable to attend.  Reading Dawn's entry I was reminded of what my nine year old self wanted to be when I grew up. 50% of me wanted to be Jamie Sommers from the Bionic Woman.  Like Dawn, who owned a Farrah Fawcett doll as a little girl, I owned a  urlLink BIONIC WOMAN DOLL .  The doll was great.  It was a great likeness to Lindsay Wagner and had removable panels on her arm and legs.  Removing the panels revealed decals of bionic circuitry.  I always wanted to have special powers when I was a little girl.  Dawn grew up to be a beautiful woman just as she desired. Sadly, I was not able to grow electronic circuitry to improve the strength of my thighs and forearm.  Nor was I able to develop super duper hearing.  Also, when I run, there is no music playing in the background and if you look at me when I'm running, it appears that I am running in real time and not in slow motion.  The other person my nine year old self wanted to be when she grew up was  urlLink Nadia Comanici .  I was obsessed with her the year she won the olympics and most of my playing was centered around walking back and forth on a picnic bench at my friends house.  In my mind, I was performing a balance bar routine.  For your amusement, I scanned the photo my mother took during one of these play sessions.	f

THE BIRDS   Nothing says good morning like finding your sunroof open after a good rainfall the night before.  Although nothing compares to the not one, but  TWO  bird nests my mechanic found in  urlLink CONNIE'S  truck this Saturday.  One under the hood that was empty and one tucked up under her rear axle which sounded like it had 2 or 3 little chirpers in there.  When the mechanic put the truck up on the lift to change Connie's oil, one little pink bird fell out.  That's when they found the one in the read axle.  When they went to check the fluids, that's when they found the empty one under the hood.  Sadly we don't think the baby birds survived the weekend because her truck wasnt in her driveway and they probably didn't get fed by the mother.  Only Connie...	m
"I suck at this game.  So I go to the EL last night and I walk past a hunky (though young-looking) dude sitting in a sleeveless T-shirt and baggy gym shorts on the platform.  He doesn't even look up, so I keep on walking and I wait for the train at the other end of the platform.  The train comes, I get on, I sit down, I start reading ... and I suddenly notice he's sitting right across the aisle from me.  Which means either: 1) He randomly wandered to the same train I'm on and my imagination's just in overdrive. 2) He followed me 'cause he wants me BAD.  And it definitely means: 1) He's fucking HOT up close.  Then both of us keep ""looking"" around the train, craning our necks this way and that in a shameless effort to just happen to lock eyes once in a while.  Which we do.  A lot.  Then we get to the part where I have no idea what to say or do.  ""Excuse me, but I noticed we seem to be flirting. Wanna see my cock?""  ""Dude.  Nice legs.  They'd look great wrapped around my neck.""  ""Man, it's  hot  in here.  Mind if I take off my shirt?""  The possibilities are endless ... if you're doing bad porn.  Anyway, we get to my stop.  He's momentarily distracted by his book.  I get off.  He doesn't notice until the doors close and the train starts pulling away and our eyes meet once more through the window.  And I lose yet another chance to either: 1) Get harassed for being a fag. 2) Bang a really hot guy."	m

Toaster's rules for life;  #1 - The grass is always greener on the other side.  If you're single, you want a girly. If you're with somebody, you want to be single again. I say live for the moment.

"My cousin sent me an article about crisis in Venezuela from  urlLink the Nation . It appears as though the Venezualan wealthy and the US are supporting a coup to oust Hugo Chávez, who ""is the best thing that has happened to Venezuela's poor in a very long time. His government has actually delivered on some of its promises, with improved literacy rates and more students getting school meals. Public spending has quadrupled on education and tripled on healthcare, and infant mortality has declined. The government is promoting one of the most ambitious land-reform programs seen in Latin America in decades."" The economy has growing steadily during his rule, but there has been about a 4 decline of GDP that are likely the result of ""oil strikes, a coup attempt and capital flight."" The US-backed coup attempt in 2002 failed because millions rallied for Chávez. I'd link to the article, but it's only available to subscribers. I'll put up the whole thing in a comment if you want. The line breaks might mess up in there, so I could email it to you if you want it that badly."	m

"Cluckin' Fillet   As church let out yesterday it hit me.  I wanted a Chik-fil-A sandwich for lunch.  So Donna and I decided to eat there.  When we arrived in the parking lot of the free standing unit I saw and remembered Chik-fil-A isn't open on Sundays.  I knew this.  It's pretty common knowledge.  The fact had slipped our minds.  Glancing across the street we saw the glorious presence of Hardee's (sarcasm mine).  We'd settle.  Donna asked if I'd like a chicken sandwich there instead.  I told her that I had gotten my hopes up and that even while biting I'd be thinking of Chik-fil-A and would thus be disappointed.  After entering and staring at the menu we moved toward the counter.    Cashier: Would you like to try our chick' fillet sandwich? Me: (laughing) no. Me: I'll have two number 4's. Cashier: That'll be $9.53.  transfer of funds   order laid on tray  Me: (to clarify, so not to seem rude) I laughed earlier because I had wanted a Chik-fil-A sandwich. I had forgotten that they were closed on Sunday.   It was just funny.  That's where I really wanted to go.  Cashier laughed   I turn with tray to the soda fountain  Donna: Be sure to blog about how you told the girl at Hardee's that you really wanted Chik-fil-A. Me: (realizing how I still sounded) oh.  The Frisco Burger was good as always, but deep down I was still hungry for that special chicken sandwich.  So today Donna and I went to the one in the mall.  Those sandwiches are so good.  Chik-fil-a is by far my favorite fast food place.  When leaving the mall we walked up and got refills.  After Donna thanked her the girl said ""my pleasure.""  I found that expression humorous.  I said ""it's almost like she's emphatically saying  No, Thank You! Refills are my calling!'""   I think its cool Chik-fil-A is closed on Sundays, I respect that.  But it would be better if they'd leave a few bags of food out for whoever might drive up."	m

Although it is annoying this is getting pretty comical! Usually wednesday is band day, and usually there is actually band, but lately I've been going and there isn't anything. There wasn't anything on friday, and 4 or 5 times before that they've had it canceled, but I walked in and there wasn't any band, so I'm a bit peeved. Its not their fault though I suppose, because tomorrow there is a play, and so they were getting the stage in the gym ready. (We have band in the gym.) So actually this time there was a good reason for it.   anyway I was reading dans blog from last night, and I think thats a great idea for a contest. Here is the contest.

Never ever have I...  (all you Ole Miss grads know what I am talking about) I have never lived in an apartment before. Then again, I have never lived in the Delta before either. One of my biggest fears since finding out I was going to be placed in Cleveland was where James and I were going to live. James has a few more classes to take at Ole Miss in Oxford and he has a good job in Batesville, but Cleveland is about two hours away from Oxford and about an hour and a half away from Cleveland. It was hard to find a town that was appropriate distances and times away from work and school for both of us. I thought (for a nanosecond) about rooming with some of the other teacher corps members that will be teaching in Cleveland, and seeing James on weekends. However, I like seeing James everyday (duh! I married him!). So anyway, I have looked at rental property in four different towns, measured distances, timed times, and worried about where we could continue to live together (hence marriage-legal license to live together) but still not have to drive over and hour to work or school.   And the winner is....  Clarksdale is only about a 45-minute drive away from Cleveland and Batesville. It is around an hour and 15 minutes away from Oxford, but we don't have to go to classes as often (or as early) as we have to go to work. Everyone recommended to Country Club Apartments in Clarksdale. James and I settled on a two-bedroom townhouse type apartment. The complex has a decent pool and they are going to completely redo the inside of our apartment before we move in the last week of July. For those of you familiar with Oxford the townhouse is similar to One Anderson Place (the two floor townhouse things off of West Jackson Ave). So anyway, that is one less thing to worry about.  The self-proclaimed Queen (for life) of Procrastination has returned!  Tons of things to do and too tired to think. Teach class. Go to class. Do homework. Grade class work. Dream about being in class. Teach class. Go to class... you get the picture. I have to be at Oxford Middle School by 7:30 am, which means I have to leave my house (Water Valley, MS) at 7 am. We generally get done there by noon. I eat in my car on my way across town to my graduate school class that starts at one. We get out of class sometime between 3:30 and 5:00 pm. After class I try and workout if I am not exhausted, do any necessary grocery-shopping, bill paying, etc. Then I go home try and figure out what to eat (and what to feed James), attempt some cleaning, and then try to focus on my homework and reading assignments for class the next day while grading or preparing stuff for my mornings at Oxford Middle School. Here lately I have also been driving to my parents' every weekend to try and help out with the coffee house they started in memory of my sister (www.cchouse.us). This weekend James and I are planning on staying in Oxford so that we can relax a little bit (driving so much is very draining). I am really enjoying all of my classes, but I am definitely looking forward to a weekend off.	f

I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to read some of the other papers that students have written to see different perspectives on the topics.  I will share mine, it was based on The Great Gatsby, and I chose the second prompt that concerned how the book has influenced our beliefs....read mine but I would   really   like to read others papers so please share.  A Positive Influence on My Beliefs  I have been raised to believe in the importance of Christian values that have shaped me into the moral person I am today.  After reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and encountering the degradation of values concerning upper-class society in the 1920’s, I have been influenced to strengthen my moral values. Fitzgerald’s novel is portrayed through a description of two wealthy Long Island communities where the center of attention is the Gatsby mansion where “The Great Gatsby” holds his famous parties where Fitzgerald focuses his novel on the characters of Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway(the narrator).  Fitzgerald uses the beliefs of these characters to mock and show the beliefs of 1920’s upper-class society. Jay Gatsby is an “Oxford man” who, after fighting in World War I becomes fabulously wealthy through criminal business to pursue his love-Daisy Buchanan.  Gatsby is portrayed as a mysterious figure who everyone admires for his extravagant amount of wealth.  Gatsby’s attitude toward money is shown in a quote that is taken from a flashback on Gatsby’s life stating  “To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.”  The authors reasoning for showing the materialistic attitude is for the reader to make the connection of how money can corrupt one’s thinking.  Gatsby, like many other characters in the novel, is so engrossed in wealth that it seems to be the sole thing that gives him satisfaction in his life.  Gatsby’s obsession with wealth is nothing compared to the attitude of Daisy Buchanan, a longtime lover of Gatsby.  Daisy Buchanan is not interested in love, but completely in material possessions.  Daisy’s attitude is best described in a quote when Daisy is admiring en extensive collection of Gatsby’s shirts.  She states,  “They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds.  ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.”  Fitzgerald is able to portray a multitude of character insights in this small quote.  First and foremost Fitzgerald is depicting Daisy as a fool for being so engrossed in a collection of shirts.  Also, the author gives insight as to what Daisy’s true love is-wealth.  Daisy married her husband Tom because he had money, not because she loved him as a person.  Tom knows what Daisy’s true love is, and in response began an affair with a woman in the city.  Fitzgerald uses Daisy’s attitude and the relationship between Tom and Daisy to show the corrupt beliefs of upper-class marriages during this time period.  Fitzgerald is saying that upper-class marriages weren’t based upon love-but two selfish people getting what they, without regard to morals. While most the characters are immersed in materialism, Nick Carraway has contrasting beliefs.  Nicks beliefs are based upon morals, not money.  In the end of the novel, Nick makes the decision to move away from the upper-class society of the East, and move back to the Midwest where morality is more important than money.  Nick describes his decision when saying “...the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.  So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry on the line I decided to come back home.”  Nick makes a decision to get away from what he knows will influence him and eventually corrupt his beliefs. Through analyzing the beliefs of these characters, my own personal beliefs have been influenced greatly.  Fitzgerald’s portrayal of a corrupt upper-class society made me realize that I am so very fortunate and that I take for granted the wealth that I am immersed in.  I am far from a Daisy Buchanan, but am still caught up in material possessions from time to time.  After reading this book, I am sickened that the upper-class in this book wasted their lives living a life where they were unable to love one another normally because they were so greatly influenced by material possessions.  What is the point in having an extravagant shirt collection?  Where is the need to host a party every weekend that leads to a myriad of people being plastered with alcohol.  It is a complete waste that I don’t ever want to be a part of.   I have developed such strong beliefs from reading this book that instead of spending my money on upgrading my car this summer, it will go towards something useful.  I am so very glad I read this book, for it opened my eyes to what is really important in life and that is not possessions, it is giving back when I have the ability to share my wealth.  SO THERES MY PAPER.......WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK?	m

Just in case you didn't know, a written copy is dur TOMORROW!!  First paragraph:  Good afternoon Mrs Thompson and class,  Establishing a utopia would be an ideal solution to solving mankind’s problems.   We currently live in a world full of greed, apathy, hate, corruption and extreme inequality. As a result millions suffer. Suffer from being ignored by the rest of society. The capitalist way of living has failed, taking with it countless victims of poverty and neglect. It is therefore my belief a utopia should be established, mirrored from Thomas More’s novel “Utopia”.	f
The King Has Returned! (Did he ever!)   This past friday night I watched THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING for the THIRD time since it's release. Well, I saw the FELLOWSHIP once, and the TWO TOWERS twice, so I only saw it fit to see RETURN OF THE KING three times!...yup, there's no logic in that whatsoever, but I couldn't help it. No but serously, my main purpose on friday WAS to accompany those (Iya, Joe and Randy) who had not the pleasure of viewing the excellent film yet. I loved how Iya would tap me every other scene if she had a question! One time during the movie we moved in at the same time and bumped heads! But I digress...  The first time I saw FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, I thought it was a scary movie. I jumped a couple times during the film (when Bilbo's face turns monstrous when he asks Frodo to give him the ring at Rivendell and when Galadriel becomes this creepy, evil ghost lady when the fellowship was in Lorien). But then I saw it a second time in the comfort of my own living room and I was suddenly inspired (not only by Orlando Bloom), but by the story itself. By the time THE TWO TOWERS had been released, I had become a fan. I read all three books (save for the HOBBIT, which is my next venture) and waited anxiously for the third installment of Tolkien's masterpiece.   So I've sat in the theater for 3 hours and 21 minutes (THREE TIMES) for RETURN OF THE KING and each time I was nothing short of enthralled at this epic on the big screen before me. The film is so powerful, with its battle scenes, and at times so heartwrenching that you forget it's a fantasy (or is it?). Even though I had read the books and I knew what scenes were to follow, I was scared for Frodo  Sam with that evil and conniving Gollum hanging on them; I was proud of Pippin and Merry, who although had thought they were too little to fight for themselves, much less all of Middle Earth, showed themselves to be worth of the greatest honor one can bestow on such courageous beings; I saw the fear and doubt in Gandalf, who everyone depends on for guidance; I was anxious for Aragorn to apply that courage and fearlessness to the regal future before him and rescue his beloved Arwen from a deadly fate she chose in order to be with him; I marveled at Gimli and Legolas, who through their devotion to the Aragorn and the fellowship, managed to thwart their disdain in order to form a friendship between the unlikeliest of peoples in Middle Earth; I saw Faramir  Eowyn, who (I might be killing this for someone who hasn't read the book) I couldn't be happier, formed a most perfect union symbolizing the bond between Rohan and Gondor.  Am I reading too into it? Maybe. Kinda proves the kind of genius J.R.R. Tolkien was though, doesn't it, to move his readers in the way that he has. And the genius of Peter Jackson and his team to aid our visual needs. I can't wait for the dvd...and moreover...THE EXTENDED VERSION! I predict THAT's gonna be at least 4 1/2 hours long at the very least...with this I say BRING ON THE POPCORN!	f

I have tons I could write about but I'm too tired and hungry and wanting to see what will happen with my day.	f
Hello, It has been sometime since I last posted on here.  I have been busy with laziness and other things.  Here is whats going on in my life:  1. I am working now.  I work for the Pennsylvania Radio Project Office in Harrisburg, PA.  I monitor tower sites for problems (power, no connectivity, etc) and fix them or get the process in motion to get them fixed.  It is a good job and hope it becomes full time.  2.  I just returned from Vacation.  I went out to Kansas (you know where Dorothy and Toto live).  My mom is from there and her family had a reunion.  So I took off work and went with them.  We (my dad, mom, brother and his gf) drove out to Kansas.  It is a 2-day drive but sometimes y0u can do it in one 24 hr period.  We get out to Kansas and have the reunion and spend alot of time with family.  We also spend nights in different people's homes.  This prooves to be interesting since each time I sleep in a different bed, I dont sleep very well.  But I managed.  So we visited alot with family and ate alot of food (diet time).  We left on Thursday morning at 10 am (mom makes us get off late).  We then stop for our lunch and supper somewhere in Columbia, Missouri.  At that point we make the decision to drive thru the night and arrive home between 7 and 8 am on Friday.  My brother drove from 3 pm to like 1 or 2 in the morning.  He took us from Missouri to Ohio and then my parents drove from Ohio to Pennsylvania.  (I was took tired to drive, I slept in the backseat of the van).  So this has been my life for the past few weeks.  Tomorrow I can go to church.  It will be my first time back to church since I started my new job.  So I am excited.	m

"Jesus the Light of the Soul  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Mane nobiscum, Domine, quoniam advesperascit. Stay with us, because it is towards evening.   1. I adore Thee, O my God, as the true and only Light! From Eternity to Eternity, before any creature was, when Thou wast alone, alone but not solitary, for Thou hast ever been Three in One, Thou wast the Infinite Light. There was none to see Thee but Thyself. The Father saw that Light in the Son, and the Son in the Father. Such as Thou wast in the beginning, such Thou art now. Most separate from all creatures in this Thy uncreated Brightness. Most glorious, most beautiful. Thy attributes are so many separate and resplendent colours, each as perfect in its own purity and grace as if it were the sole and highest perfection. Nothing created is more than the very shadow of Thee. Bright as are the Angels, they are poor and most unworthy shadows of Thee. They pale and look dim and gather blackness before Thee. They are so feeble beside Thee, that they are unable to gaze upon Thee. The highest Seraphim veil their eyes, by deed as well as by word proclaiming Thy unutterable glory. For me, I cannot even look upon the sun, and what is this but a base material emblem of Thee? How should I endure to look even on an Angel? and how could I look upon Thee and live? If I were placed in the illumination of Thy countenance, I should shrink up like the grass. O most gracious God, who shall approach Thee, being so glorious, yet how can I keep from Thee?  2. How can I keep from Thee? For Thou, who art the Light of Angels, art the only Light of my soul. Thou enlightenest every man that cometh into this world. I am utterly dark, as dark as hell, without Thee. I droop and shrink when Thou art away. I revive only in proportion as Thou dawnest upon me. Thou comest and goest at Thy will. O my God, I cannot keep Thee! I can only beg of Thee to stay. ' Mane nobiscum, Domine, quoniam advesperascit .' Remain till morning, and then go not without giving me a blessing. Remain with me till death in this dark valley, when the darkness will end. Remain, O Light of my soul,  jam advesperascit ! The gloom, which is not Thine, falls over me. I am nothing. I have little command of myself. I cannot do what I would. I am disconsolate and sad. I want something, I know not what. It is Thou that I want, though I so little understand this. I say it and take it on faith; I partially understand it, but very poorly. Shine on me,  O Ignis semper ardens et nunquam deficiens !'O fire ever burning and never failing'and I shall begin, through and in Thy Light, to see Light, and to recognise Thee truly, as the Source of Light.  Mane nobiscum ; stay, sweet Jesus, stay for ever. In this decay of nature, give more grace.  3. Stay with me, and then I shall begin to shine as Thou shinest: so to shine as to be a light to others. The light, O Jesus, will be all from Thee. None of it will be mine. No merit to me. It will be Thou who shinest through me upon others. O let me thus praise Thee, in the way which Thou dost love best, by shining on all those around me. Give light to them as well as to me; light them with me, through me. Teach me to show forth Thy praise, Thy truth, Thy will. Make me preach Thee without preachingnot by words, but by my example and by the catching force, the sympathetic influence, of what I doby my visible resemblance to Thy saints, and the evident fulness of the love which my heart bears to Thee.

Okay, so my day at work was well, crappy to say the least. Management at times really sucks, for you people out there that work for management, let me give you a tip on the inside. If your manager it hard on you, realize it's because they are responsible for you to their leaders. And when you slack or don't take the initiative it's the manager's fault. Have some sympathy for your managers and realize they have a lot of responsibility and that helping them helps you.  So on another note, I'm making huge progress in my life. I come from a family of alcoholics and it has dramatically affected my attitude and reactions to life. I just recently got involved with the Al-Anon program, and am very excited for the 12 steps I am about to embark on. If this is something that you might be dealing with, drop me a line, it might be helpful.   thanks for staying tuned	f
"""Poppies will help them sleep.....""  Rumsfeld is taking Action. Yep.  and this only means our Government wants  to spend more Money and  RULE THE WORLD IN THE NAME OF  GOD AND DEMOCRACY!!!   The Cultivation of Opium Poppies is a huge business in the lovely country of Afghanistan. HOW huge???? Three-Quarters of the WORLD'S Opium Poppy Trade  comes out of Afghanistan.  Most heads up to Europe, which aids in  supplying the junkies  with their beloved Heroin.  $2.3 BILLION accounts for more than  HALF of the nation's gross domestic revenue..... here in the States, we also keep that  trade flowing from this monstrously profitable crop.  Naturally, the genius that is Rumsfeld made this whammy of an observation that the United States needs to  Intervene with ANOTHER affair. when Afghanistan will have the World Record Poppy Crop this Year.  AND, this is AFTER the fact that the  Taliban's Religious policies.... (a method continually used by various  governments...BUT NEVER WORKS as a preventive method fully....) eliminated quite a bit of the crops, but farmers still find ways around the system, and the cultivation and harvesting has flourished since 2001.... and after the Fall of the Taliban.  Good-Ol' Donald also  makes another wonderful exclamation that  these ""Criminals are Opposed to  a Strong, Democratic Government""  (yes kids....the wisdom is OVERFLOWIN' NOW....) and that the Drug Profits  can be tied to the Taliban and Al-Qaida... kinda like the weapons of mass destruction phenom.... so....we best get our asses in there and do something about that, too.  On top of dropping $3.3 BILLION for a  FIVE YEAR MILITARY PACKAGE towards the ""efforts"" down in Colombia to eradicate the cocaine trade.... which has made no dent whatsoever in getting it off the streets or downplay the street value here in the U.S.... for there still is ""no shortage of the supply""... how the hell does it  make sense to continue the  financial plunge attempting to ""Stop"" something else?? sending more troops off for  another ""just"" purpose??  So....diminish the starving farmers that are merely  surviving off of addicts and rich assholes that stock the supply for the U.S. in the first place...since coffee doesn't pull in shit for  income compared to the cola plant... that became a drug and is purchased by those with the money to do so??  like, the ""War on Terror""...with more threats than ever??  why does this sound like an overpriced equation that nine year olds in business suits  can't compute, explain or figure out?  hopefully....the meteor shower can be  visual tonight....reminding me that we are nothing but  floating particles announcing our ""purpose"" in the most meaningless ways possible.  it's all so conspicuously benighted....

Anyway, one of our convos was about how the Catholic Church had recently proclaimed that they will not distribute Communion to any parishoner who is involved with abortion practices(aka a doc who performs them, etc.).  Now is my church, just this past Sunday, our priest gave us a lecture about leaving early and coming late and then dropped the bomb: apparently some people in our church have not been eating their host at Communion and have been leaving it in the pews and song books instead.  Of course for a devout Catholic who believes that the host is actually the body of Christ, this is a tragedy.  As for me, I was just waiting for him to say ""The body of Christ does not belong in the pews or the song books, it needs to get in your belly!"".   Oh and btw, The Cure, Interpol, Mogwai and others will be touring this summer, according to the Cure's website.  Looks like Cincy, Chi-town, and Detroit are all on the list, but no Indy...."	f
I Guess I Shouldn't Be Surprised.   I have been roaming the internet for the last three days and I have found some fucked up shit.  Not dirty, disgusting shit (although, there is plenty of that too) but things like, a gay man's tribute to knitting, or a website devoted to the glory of shoe horns.  It's strangely disturbing and yet somewhat satisfying to know that if I should ever require knowledge about the mating rituals of ancient inca tribes, it's only a click away.  If I was a teacher, I would assign reports on very strange things, just to see if my kids could successfully trek their way through the mire that is the internet and come up aces.  It takes some skill to use the internet properly.  Any meathead can use the internet to buy stocks, find pictures of naked people, read comics or read reviews of video games.  I'm talking about navigating through webrings and bypassing sleeze to get to the only website about making yo-yo's out of pig intestines.  That takes cunning.  With all that tasty information out there I still use the internet for three things: email, webcomics and this here.  Sure, sometimes, I like to check baseball scores or read about DnD books, but that's only like a couple times a month.  I still get all my sports info from ESPN the tv station and my DnD information usually comes from Adam or Billy.  As great as the interent is, I couldn't imagine obtaining  all  my information from it.  Books are still pretty cool and TV is a great for rotting the brain, also I like to have friends.  I got to meet Scott Kurtz, of  urlLink PvP , on Saturday.  It was cool, him and Aaron Williams, of  urlLink Nodwick  and  urlLink PS238  were at Pop Culture Comics is OP, I chatted with them and got Scott to sign a copy of Striptease (a book collecting his webcomic) and he drew me a sketch as well.  Nice guy.  If I'm ever that fat I need someone to come over and tie me up and break my jaw so I stop eating.  Nice guy, though.  This concludes your lesson for today.  I'll expect your report about Nigerian fire breathing garden gnomes on my desk tomorrow morning.  Dismissed.	m

Won a RoboSapien from Woot!   Just took a look at  urlLink Engadget  and noticed my name as the latest winner of a  urlLink RoboSapien  from Woot!'s giveaway. I haven't heard anything back about winning the Kensington mouse and Splinter Cell package, so I don't know about actually getting this either, but I did buy that surround sound system from them and it works great. So I can't say anything bad about them because I did get what I payed money for and that's what matters. If I do get the robot thing, I'll have to bring it into work because it probably won't get used much at home.	m
"This is from my friend Heather.  It's a commentary about technology that I think hits the nail on the head:   Most people: ""this is not working, I will call someone to fix it."" me and You: ""This is not working. Why? What if I tried this? Maybe if i do this? Let me see if the help menu can help me. Let me check out the support page on the web. Ok. Now I'm stumped. Where's the phone?""  I blame dependency on technology. We're taught to use a calculator, but not how to add or subtract. We're taught how to use our computers, but not how they operate.  We don't need to know these things, because somewhere out there a computer or machine can do it for us.     Heather is perceptive.  And she rocks."	m

"Hi all!  Don't know if this was posted on the blog but Greg K spoke at Seton Hall University on Nov. 19 about his embedded experiences, along with a panel of other journos and politicos.

"we walked around the waterfront area of digby (n.s.) and tried to decide between the handful of ""seafood"" restaurants from their exterior and advertised specials which would be the most pleasing.   captain's cabin restaurant  looked big and had many specials advertised so we headed in.  it wasn't quite so big inside and we seated ourselves in the ""fancier"" side that had a burgandy tableclothes protected by a plastic sheet on the table top.  the room had a tall sloping roof lending a rustic air.  our server was also very rustic, being all touchy-feely with my parents (no worries, she was just kind of granny-like and possibly that in real life).  my father ordered the pork chops (always the ""turf"" guy, 8.99?).  mum ordered the pan-fried haddock (9.99).  (aside: i thought digby was all about scallops and clams but they also lay claim to the best haddock and salmon.  we were told that haddock is the cleanest fish, therefore you don't have to add much flavour while pan-frying it.)  i ordered ""large"" clams and chips (15.69 or so).  and k ordered a pound of pan-fried ""world-famous"" digby scallops (18.69).  didn't try the pork chops so i couldn't comment on it.  the clams were as expected, but not quite the heaping portion that a ""large"" or price would suggest.  (say, you can get clams  chips in the city for under $12.)  they were whole clams and thankfully for batter and oil, adequately tasty.  my mashed potatoes, carrots, and squash were the blandest vegetables ever.  the scallops were tiny and i personally wonder at the 1 lb. moniker.  they were okay, grilled with some butter.  same very bland vegetables.  mum got a rice pilaf so she didn't have to suffer the parsley-sprinkled mashed potatoes.  her haddock was lightly battered and then pan-fried.  in my opinion it wasn't bad but i'm also able to tolerate, even enjoy, bland cuisine.  seasoning it with lemon juice was helpful.  all in all, it wasn't so bad when you thought hard about it.  it's probably positively delicious for many of the much older, possibly local, customers.  otherwise, we are a little too young (even my parents!) for this kind of really old-fashioned cuisine.  another rustic touch: you can see your direct-from-food-broker desert in the display fridge, on plain white dishes and wrapped individually in saran-wrap....  on sunday, i vetoed our ""usual"" hangouts like yfm and fireside.  nothing against them but i wanted to go somewhere that i could review!  so we ended up at  ryan duffy's bar  grill  located on the upper level above swanky mini mall spring garden place.  ryan duffy's is one of those restaurants that have a swanky side and a fine dining side.  (other restaurants i can think of like this include five fishermen/little fish and salty's.)  i reason to myself that it's all the same kitchen so it's a pretty good deal....  :p  while the down-to-earth counterpart of the other two restaurants are really down-to-earth, ryan-duffy's-normal-side is pretty nice depending on where you sit, i guess: we directed ourselves to a four-person table in a sort of alcove where each of us got velvety armchairs.  i ordered duck ravioli for us to start with (7.99) and a special: seafood-stuffed salmon with dill hollandaise (12.95).  mona ordered... name of the dish eludes me at the moment... stuffed chicken (9.99?), essentially, while s. ordered chicken oscar (9.50?).  it took a while for the ravioli to arrive so we eagerly lapped it up.  there were six pieces containing minced duck meat and painted with mango/ginger sauce.  it was a ""chef's own creation,"" and nearly divine.  it took another while for the main course to arrive (my baked dish was to blame) and when it did, i was grudgingly pleased with the presentation.  s.'s chicken oscar consisted of lobster and chicken in roll of phyllo pastry.  it looked good and garnished with julienned carrots and parsley.  mona and my dishes were colourful with sides of steamed vegetables (yellow, red, and green peppers, snowpeas, and broccoli) - this is something i appreciate - and rice pilaf - for which i have a softness.  i still haven't identified exactly what was in the ""stuffing"" that lay on top of the baked salmon: mushroom, fish(?), cheese....  it was very good in any case.  mona's chicken breast was stuff with spinach and cheese.  since i was sitting during the meal facing the overhanging chalkboard with the daily specials, i was considering the cheesecake: new york-style chocolate strawberry (5.95) and caved in and ordered it for us to split.  another wait followed before we were presented with with a slice of chocolate cheesecake drizzled with strawberry topping and another white sauce (like liquid icing sugar).  the cheesecake was divine.  it might not have been baked and almost had the consistency of chocolate mousse (that i adore).  chocolate + strawberry is a winning combination.  part of the reason why i picked ryan duffy's again was because i went a couple of years ago (around april, for shaf's bday), and i was pleased back then as well.  good to see they are still serving it up well!  captain's cabin 1996 ltd. address: 2 birch, digby (ns) phone: 902-245-4868  ryan duffy's steak  seafood address: 5640 spring garden road, halifax phone: 902-421-1116     urlLink read more...."	f

"urlLink Democratic Underground Forums - GDP up 7.2%, we are toast   The denizens of the Democratic Underground greet the news of our raging GDP numbers announced today.  ""Sure, I believe these numbers.  Just like I believed that Iraq had WMD. Just like I believed that the 2 taxcuts would create jobs. Just like I believe he won the 2000 election.  Sorry, but if this were truely the case, I think it's solely in the province of the 1% who had $5TT delivered back to them by Dimson. He distorts or kills all data coming from every Department in the federal government, so why would I believe this? A real 7.2% bounce would have this economy raging...that ain't happening.""  More -   They ARE getting desperate, but that is only pushing them more swiftly to Totalitarian Heights that were coming anyway.  Yes, comrade, and Toilet Paper Production went up 600% last year.  Even if this number is remotely true and not to be ""corrected downward"" in a month with no publicity thus remaing in the Public Mind, then it is based on stolen loot from Iraq, stolen loot from the Amerikan Imperial Taxpayer, and the fact that the Busheviks have been increasingly ratcheting up their use of governmental agencies as political platforms.  Just like the Old Soviet Union.  With each year that passes, the Busheviks get closer to that Perfect Soviet 100% lie.  To me, this Soviet-style number indicates that, due to increased desperation and the fact that people are seeing through their old lies, the Busheviks are taking the lies to another level.  I warn you, they are not done ratcheting up and, should the Imperial Family remain in power for decades, we WILL reach that perfect Soviet media atmosphere the Busheviks so admire and desire.  No filters then, just Comrade Bushevik's Unadulterated Truths."	m
I'm currently planning a trip to  urlLink Las Vegas  this summer with my wife and brother-in-law, and guess if I was surprised when I noticed that the price for the  trip had gone down $34 per person since last night! That's a huge difference for a three day trip. We still haven't really decided on the hotel though. At the moment it looks like it'll be  urlLink The Mirage  or  urlLink TI , but it could just as well be  urlLink MGM Grand  or  urlLink The Flamingo . If the price continues to drop at this rate, which is highly unlikely, but not impossible, we might even stay at one of the more  urlLink expensive hotels .  Any ideas, suggestions or warnings are more than welcome! Feel free to send me a mail at  urlLink blogger@ow.nu .	m

Finally I've got my Internet connection back. What a relief. I must say, I can't survive without it. All those times I needed the Net for research, to await mails and simply to chat with friends. I miss coming here too; there were so many things I needed to say here.   I passed my driving test on Monday and the feeling was just so awesome. To finally get past that 'hurdle'...phew. Anyway, I was there with Shaun and Christobel and we met a couple of people there as well. Mostly their friends, so it was a bit awkward for me at first. I got to know this girl with a really unique accent, Emily, and this cute Norwegian guy, Kristien (I think that's how his name is spelt). Well, all of us passed except Christobel. She couldn't get past the slope, which was kinda scary. When it was Shaun and my turn, we were really freaked out. And it was raining and we were like the last ones to do the slope. Thankfully, all went well. Phew. Now, I await my license in silence. haha. Oh, Shaun is cute too. Not those typical cute guy, but cute nevertheless. I guess it's cuz he's always kidding around and being really nice and friendly.   My results arrived yesterday - exactly the same as 1st semester. -_- . I nearly got the perfect score I so crave for for Physics but it was not to be. I missed but a few decimal points. What in the world? I'll get my revenge this semester. Haha. And I also wanna make my Chem teacher proud. I don't know why. I just have to do really well for CHemistry. After all, isn't it my favourite subject? Also, maths. I can't let her down. Groanz. All the pressure.	f

Good News  Eventually, you will really have a good relationship with your mom as long as you just accept her, you're over 30 (because it takes time), and she never put out her cigarettes on your back or dated your boyfriends.    This Saturday I bought my mom a nice handbag for Father's Day and one for myself just because.  Then my mom asked me about that pair of pants she'd given me to stitch up on my fancy shmantzy sewing machine.    So, on Sunday night I started working on them thinking that I'd do it right before bed but, my God, there were holes and tears all along the seams and each time I thought I was done I noticed another rip.  And finally around 1am I called Mom up and told her that there was no hope.  I didn't know if these were her favorite pair of pants or what...but they're not gonna make it mom!  I tried and I tried but there are too many holes!!  The fabric is weak!  And I was stressing about about the pants and shoulder pain and running out of bobbin thread and she says, ""throw them out"".  What?!!   I keep forgetting to always watch what I say at work and to not say everything that I think and to be calm and its hard to say the right thing all the time.

Since my last entry, I’ve had to lay off again.  I got a good run in Friday morning before having my stitches removed, only to find out that this would be my last run for several days.  I’m still not quite sure why the nurse took them out because they weren’t ready.  All weekend they’ve been trying to split open.  I’ve been stuck working out at the gym on the stationary bike and elliptical machines.  Talk about boring.   I did get brave last night and play softball.  I was planning to sit out, but most of my team didn’t show, so I played.  My stitches were fine, but my jaw is another story.  At the expense of my own stupidity, I got knocked in the jaw with a softball.  It didn’t feel so bad last night, but it’s really sore today.  I’m betting I’ll have a bruise before the end of the week.  So exciting.  That’ll teach me to talk and throw a softball at the same time.  This feels oddly familiar.  When I was younger (probably 8th or 9th grade) I was talking while playing softball and got whacked in the nose.  I ended up with a broken nose and two black eyes—we call the photos my “mug shots”.  Somehow I managed to get past my fear of softballs over the years…here we go again.	f
"Dear person.  Let me answer a number of issues you raised. This is just my reading of the situation, and I can be wrong.  First, the ""lack of connection"" and the ""guardedness"" of people around you. Yes, you have this uncanny way of rubbing people the wrong way. Your lack of ""connection,"" or, let's say, personal confidence or security in your being makes you jump at the slightest sign of ""connection"" with another person. What is absolutely appalling is your tendency to ""squat"" in other people's lives. I don't know if you're famiiar with the squatting phenomenon in your country, but that is where people who don't own the land they live on stay there and claim it as their own, regardless of obvious facts. You, my friend, assume that once a person has become your friend, you have the right to intrude into their lives and assume that you have the right to refer to their friends (whom you have never met) and family (same thing) as if you knew them yourself, as if you have the same relationship with them as your new-found friend has. You presume that because now you are friends, you have to spend all your free time together. You have the right to ask what their plans are. Well, you don't. Deal with it.  Another thing is your tendency to stretch the truth. You do this all the time to the girl and me. You say things like: ""J**** wants to go to.... or ""someone"" wants to do.....,"" or worse: ""you said you wanted to.... (no, I didn't, asshole!)"" passing it off as the desire of other people when in fact, it is only you who wanted that.  Balibad pa .  We hate it that you invade our privacy and our time. We are sorry that you feel you don't have friends you can hang out with, but we, especially me, are not about to tie a rock around our necks so you can feel good about yourself. I am not a self-esteem dispenser. I have a life that does not include you, and I prefer it that way. If you can't seem to find a life of your own, I'm sorry for you. But I am not about to allow you to use me as your sounding board everytime you feel insecure, because you drain people. Yes, you go and project your: ""I'm so sad, pity me pity me"" control drama, all the while draining the energy from unsuspecting, well meaning people. Well, I've caught on to your act. Do you know what you are called? Psychics call you an emotional vampire.  You are that way because you believe in nothing. You have nowhere to draw your energy from, not even yourself because you always think you're not good enough. You want to explore the realms of faith, but I doubt if you will find what you are looking for. Because ultimately, you seek other people to provide you with that energy. You don't believe in god, the angels, or whatever metaphysical beings. You don't believe that there can be something beyond this physical world, and although you toy with the idea in our discussions, I think you will never find faith. You think too much. Faith and belief defy the rational. It is a very personal experience, based on one's feelings and instincts. You have never felt safe enough to just listen to your soul, and to follow what it says regardless of what norms or conventions you will have to break. Yes, you say you have broken your religion's conventions. But you have never really taken a stand, have you? You are too afraid of the emotional investment that fighting for something would take, so you have taken the safe way out.... Be an agnostic, wash your hands of responsibility and say: ""I don't really know."" (at your age and with all the time you spend thinking?hmmm)  It has always been your choice. You make your bed, you lie in it. So stop disturbing me. When I say I am not doing anything don't assume that it means it's ok to spend time with you. I don't want to. Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups and you, my friend, are very much that. Fucked up."	f

Written. 14. November. 2000   I had the oddest dream last night.  Or rather a series of dreams.  A family with a secret who was forced to destroy its home- and the one that sits more uneasily with me:  Alison who had powers, a dragon ability, fell in love with the devil.  And how he was attractive.  I think I fell in love with him, too.  After losing her head, she gave up her powers in order to live with him in Hell.  They left, and I was to await either his return, or David's.  Mother actually came, and there was a huge fight.  A school type function, and then I called Him- and he was so wonderful- so alluring and captivating.  He and Alison had broken up and I pleaded my case- he agreed.  Then the alarm woke me up.    I can never describe it well enough afterwards, can never get all the little details.  Was I dreaming about Keith and this upcoming date symbolically?  I wish I could find the meaning of it.  Was it a warning?  A test of some kind to be passed?  Gods, I wish I knew.  I nearly called in so I could go back to it.  I'm here at work, however.  And still very much affected by it.

There are about 11 eligible and ageing `bachelorettes in my department where at least two-thirds of them are classified into the sophisticated and intelligent types;like an assortment of  Bebe Neuwirths in different shapes and sizes.One of them happens to be my pain-in-the-ass boss, who is not only very trendy in her Al-Munawarroh fashion sense but also quite a petite,attractive woman.She is 42 years old and once admitted to me that she never wants to get married, ever. Ive wondered why.She is comfortable steering her own fate perhaps,that she has worked so hard to get to where she is now the possibility of sharing her  successes  with anyone else annoys her. Maybe,I presumed, the excuse of being alone relieves a woman from the many burdening responsibilities she was destined to have in the first place.  Or, she could just be another raging homosexual.  My boss has eternal PMS,nevertheless I find myself amused with her independence and headstrong opinions.She is,inside,a kind considerate person who only I could see as we work very closely.  Then there was that  nasty  rumour circulating around our tiny office space.Somebodys mother's ex-boyfriends sisters colleagues brother-in-laws niece who happens an ex-roomie to my cubicle neighbour had broken the news at one of them Tupperware parties. Apparently 10 years back, during my bosss heydays as a lecturer at OTM she was a bad, bad girl.  She got caught `berkhalwat in a very awkward position with a married man on campus.  And so the word got out;the battalion of makciks in the office had synchronized their watches.I think everyone knows now about how she got sacked from her teaching career because of that hanky-pankying incident.She though, until today has no idea what is happening around her, the nasty whispers, the undecipherable `faces and cynical remarks around us.Perhaps her oblivion is trying save her some remaining dignity,who knows?  I wished I could pat her head, or give her a hug;that strong,hard-willed woman.But I just can't.I didn't want to seem like an accomplice to the whole situation.  She is only human, those pricks failed to notice. Nobody had the right to judge her, however buttnaked she was at the time of `capture, or if the guy she dated had a dozen children and never intended to leave his wife for her.Really, no one wants to be punished by the past they needed to forget.  When I reflect back on my `young mistakes, I wouldnt want them to escape the Pandoras Box Ive so brilliantly stored away as it had been done upon on her.  (Cringe).	f
I swear, my fingers are cursed. Last Thursday, as I was clipping off a hangnail, I snipped my finger and it started bleeding like mad. Everything was OK since then (with the usual exceptions of slamming them in doors and things like that), but today I was grating orange peel and I slipped and sliced the skin off my thumb, and then I burned another finger when I was adjusting a rack in the oven. I really hurt. And I have to go play guitar this afternoon. Ow.  On a happier note, my house smells fantastic. Cranberry bread and pumpkin pie... and now my sister's making a cranberry-orange sauce. Yum.	f

I've deleted my personal blog.  I've realized that I couldn't stomach the idea of people reading things about the people i know and love, without those friends (and lovers ;) knowing about it.  It sickens me. I'd rather stick to clean stuff like candyaudioline does hehehe...  Don't get me wrong. It saddens me, but I think I'll feel better in time. Maybe I can start anew someday.  Sorry, nabawasan tuloy kayo ng internet soap opera fix niyo. Nyehehe.  Wala pa kaming tugtog anytime soon, except for the Matilda EP launch. Sana tumugtog na kami, for real.

OK.  So my website isn't working.  I have  no clue  as to why.  I'm not sure if the webmaster shut it down because I had my quote pages up, and they have some offensive content.  I'd think that they would send me an email telling me they'd shut it down though.  I'd also like to hope that they would allow me the option to take down the offensive material and get my site up and running again.  I worked  so  hard on that web page.  Seriously.  I'm really frustrated that it's suddenly unavailable.  I can't even get to the ftp to make changes.  When I try to go there, it freezes Ie and I have to ctrl+alt+del and start over.  So I'm thinking it's a problem with the server rather than a problem with my page.  I'm hoping so, because I worked too hard on that to have them shut it down without notice or giving me the option to fix it.	f
Well...The latest news on the twins is that MK Olsen has checked into a treatment center for an eating disorder. Sad, But totally believable. I mean she is so skinny, they both are, but Mk is way thinner. My favorite actresses have always been Mk and Ashley Olsen, and there were always so pretty, skinny, and popular. Why would one of them do that? Some questions are really hard to answer. People just need to realize that no matter what you can always get help before going to such lengths as an eating disorder. Talk 2 someone. Get help. It's that simple, or maybe not. But remember you can always talk and get help, no matter what. ~Peace n Love~ Adios  Pro-life rocks.

I know many of there faults.I'm trying to track down the list of top rated fencers who are still in high school I will find them all and beat them, get myself on that list.	m
I am an arrow honed with live's bitter circumstances, with knowledge gained through trial and error,  Aiming for a target pure, just to be like him, to love unselfishly, to follow him through it all, to get up again if I should fall and see in the mirror  Someone looking back at me that I can be proud of, not just for me but also for him above  This arrow veered off course a while, into forests dark with shadows hiding truth and light  And rocks fell from places not seen, and stole some of the arrows gleam  It was he who made the arrow and though I was not made to fail, I have a choice to lose or win  I can only hit my mark if I aim, trying not to fall again   Connie Ball 2003	f
9:05 at the beginning of this here Blog. I guess it's a capitalized thing. What should I do this morning. I could go shoot stuff, that is always fun. All I have is a BB gun, but it is still fun. OR I could sit here at my computer, and wait until someone gets on Yahoo! and then I can talk to them. Might be a while. Even if anyone was up right now, I don't think they would get on the internet. They would eat cereal, and watch TV. TV is so boring, which is why I don't watch it. Especially during the week, because they only show either adult stuff or little kid stuff from 9:00 to 2:00. Music is fun too. That is what I am doing right now. Sitting here listening to music. I love music infinitely. Even in my hours of unhappiness it was there for me. Thank you, musicians, for making what it is that you made. Lemonade. Lemon-aid. I love that song. Boy, that song makes me sad a little. I need to talk to Blake. He is cool, and also a good friend of mine. Yessir. Alright, I can't think of anything that I wanna write down anymore.	m

"Hmm... I've set up some blogs before, but they were always not successful. Now, I've set my mind to complete this blog for  as long as possible .  Went to school for only about 2 hours today, as I'm still having my mid-yrs, due to the opening ceremony. Think I'll most probably fail my Physics, so as usual will fail science too.  Since school reopened, I've been home very early everyday, mostly before 11am, due to the exams. But even after that, I've decided to come straight home everyday after school. I've given myself a time-table, and hope that I'll follow it. It'll begin next week, when my exams end.  When I come home these few days, I'm all alone, except for my Dad who's sleeping in the room. There's no one for me to talk to. Hence, I feel scared and frightened and lonely. The feeling of emptiness comes, and I feel that there is a part of me that is missing. And I think I know why. I miss  DANCING  ( Ballet  to be exact). I miss the weekly lessons, and the 2 times that I performed with Frontier Danceland. I miss the "" big sisters "" and "" little sisters "" whom I performed together with. I can still remember their names and faces, but I doubt that they still remember me. I've kept all the stuff related to the performance, including the schedules. I found the pictures that my mum took during rehearsals and the actual dance too. After seeing them dance on TV the other day, the feeling has grown even stronger. I really miss them. I found Frontier Danceland's website a few days ago, and also saw Kay's website. I really admire her since then, but I've never told her. I dream of e-mailing her, and telling her that she's my idol and all. But i don't think she'll even remember me in the first place. I've sent an email to Frontier Danceland, hoping that I can contact my teacher, Ms Loke, but I've yet to receive any reply. I'll wait a few more days, before I pluck up the courage to email Kay to ask her instead.  I really   hope   that I'll be able to go back to dancing again. It's already been  1.5  years since I stopped ballet due to academic results. I can only go back to classes at the end of this year, after I take my O'levels. I hope I still will be qualified to dance, and that I wouldn't be rusty. Hence, I've started doing stretches and some steps before I sleep every night.  I was thinking, if I didn't choose to go to ECH in poly after I graduate, (which is my other love and dream), would I be able to take dance as a course? Can I go towards the ARTS direction? I could combine  my 2 greatest love ,  Ballet  and  kids , together, and that could be my career in future. I could teach Ballet. I don't know.  Right now, all I want is to go back to classes .  Oh well, think I'll end here for today. Bye!"	f
"Hi, Just read the last two posts and wanted to respond. Oranges-- I thought it referred to Agent Orange, the cancer causing herbicide used during the Vietnam War.  Many people (Vietnamese and Americans) have suffered horrible effects from Agent Orange-- cancer, birth defects, etc. AA Men-- quite interesting comparison between AA Men and Af am women.  Chin's anger may be understandable-- but what are its implications?  If AA men feel excluded from patriarchy, then does aggressively trying to claim their share in it provide a viable answer?     Interestingly enough, alot of AA women complain that when AA men criticize them for going out with white men, the basis of the criticism is that AA women somehow are ""THEIR (i.e. AA men's)"" women.  The AA men, in contrast, argue that it isn't a matter of patriarchy or sexism, but one of assimilation-- that AA women who go out with white men are ""selling out.""     Ironically, Chin himself has a white wife...And Bruce Lee, the icon of Asian masculinity, also married a white woman.  Is there a double standard here?  Or is it okay for Asian men to go out with white women because that's somehow breaking a stereotype, whereas the reverse simply reinforces it.       Read the Cheung article for the literary ramifications of this.  Also, stay tuned for American Knees!  BH"	m

This is actually a few weeks old, but better late than never. Flight controllers for the Mars Express spacecraft decided to  urlLink delay deployment of the subsurface radar  antenna boom. They fear that the boom might swing too far and richochet back into the spacecraft, possibly damaging it and crippling the mission. A final decision on the radar's deployment will be made later this year.  The radar is designed to search up to 5 kilometers beneath the Martian surface, looking for traces of water buried beneath the rocks.	m
"nice title eh? its the name of one of my fav songs ^_^ anywho, 2day has been a typical day for the most part, which is cool, i guess.I woke up around 1:30 this afternoon, probaly since i was up til like 4 o clock last night on the computer and/or watching tv, there was like a 5 shows of mad tv in a row and i watched them all, lol then some infomercial for a ""male enchancement pill"" came on (why cant they just say a penis growth pill, like no one knws what the hell a male enhancement is -__-) and yea i wasnt gonna just sit there and watch that so thats when i decided to go to bed. then i woke up and ate a fruit salad for breakfast then awhile later got on AIM theeeen kevin called but i had to call him back later since my mom was on the phone, and yea we talked for alil then my mom decided to go out since it was her b-day, to look for her a new bike, she wanted to go to wal-mart (just.....no) for one but i convinced her to go to like Dick's (sporting goods store) or like the Catonsville Bike shop, she chose Dick's since i got my bike from there, ummmn yea we looked at bikes and this new bike rack thingiemajig, for the truck. she picked this pretty decent GT front fork suspension mountain bike, for like 250 (hah my bike was 330, i win). that took like an hour to get over with then we went to Compusa for some ink for the printer, a new mouse , and keyboard   for the comp (duh). We couldnt find the right type of ink for the printer cuz we have to get each color (cyan, light cyan, black, magenta, light magenta, and yellow) and they only had light magenta. so my mom just decided to get the keyboard and mouse. i finally have a optical mouse instead of that damn trackball mouse. then after that, she decided to go to dinner, at this place called sunset over in glen burnie, and i hate that place so i wanted to go home, my mom gave me a 20 to order a pizza with. ^_^ like 20 mins after i got home, i install the keyboard and mouse and decided to order the pizza from domino's. i ordered a large pepperoni, sausage, and ham thin crust (oh yea im healthy *sarcasm* it took like 15 mins for the pizza to come when the dude said it would be 45 mins, he lied to me.i should get 5 bucks back for that >>', it took an hr and an half for me to finish off the pizza, cuz the phone kept ringing, damnit and after that i just chilled around the house. around 10:30 my mom came back, she went to the store and got those mini little bottles of dasani (sp?) waters, which is awesome, to me atleast lol. and yea thats pretty much how my day went."	m

"Good meeting last night. I was sort of fried so Liz lead the meeting. More on Romans 12. I swear I think you could spend your whole life on this thing and still not totally get it all. We talked about verse 3 - the ""estimate yourself soberly"" one - not thinking too highly of yourself. Everyone shared about ways in which they perhaps thought too highly of themselves and how we could go about correcting that. It was good - brought out some of our stuff - honesty - good. We prayed for a little bit, then celebrated the Eucharist (we always do this).  Our meeting times aren't always or even often spectacular. If we tried to make them that way, it would be rather fake anyway, so no point. And thinking that they have to be something like that every time we meet is against the grain of our philosophy of community. It would cut against the ""long-haul"" and the ""more than a meeting"" mentality that we're trying to foster in one another. We're not about getting everything done in the once a week meeting. It can't be done - was never meant to be done - so we don't try to do it. Our formation into the image of Christ is a wholisitc thing that happens all the time, by many means. We're not about ""quick-fixes"" either. Things don't generally work that way in the spiritual life. We are in process. It's a long haul thing, not an instantaneous fixer-upper.  I hope all that makes some sense. We live as community. We go along doing what we know to do. We listen and evolve as we need to. God transforms us along the way."	m
"For those of us on the east coast, we had to stay up close to 11PM for this gem. It was the most pointed political comment of the day. It came during Ron Reagan's comments at his father's grave.  ""Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious man. But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians wearing his faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and nearly killed early in his presidency, he came to believe that God had spared him in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, not a mandate. And there is a profound difference.""   Ouch!! Guess he disagrees with John Ashcroft's notion of the divine right of kings."	f
If you already read Kim's blog from earlier today, or if you happen to read the blog backwards, then you know I have good news.  I met with the professor from  urlLink Montclair State , and he told me he's going to have the school write me an official letter of acceptance into grad school!  Dude, I can't even tell you how happy I am after hearing that.  He was really nice and helpful.  He explained the three paths in communication I can take, and recommended the first two classes to take.  He also said that I may have a good chance of gaining a teaching assistantship since I have some teaching background, and a communication background.  I am so psyched.  So that's the good news of the day.    My appointment was at 12:30, and I was done by 1, so I decided to do some Christmas shopping since I took the day off from work.  I finished shopping for Kim, mom, dad, my brother, my uncle and his girlfriend.  All that in an hour and 15 minutes.  I got to the mall at 1:30 and left at 2:45.  I beat traffic home as well.  It was a pretty sweet few hours.  Unfortunately, it's back to work tomorrow in a blizzard, or so I hear.  I'm not ready for snow yet.  If it's going to be a big storm, then this is one of the earliest big snowfalls I can remember.  Usually they hit in Feb or March.  Anyway, that's winter for you.  I think if I feel adventurous, I may tinker with my  urlLink webpage  today.  Kim's at school, and I don't have anything else to do.	m

"Lately, I've been doing some remodeling of my entire website since I felt it badly needed a  new look  that's more in tune with the 21st century.  Remember it was originally created in 1997.  Besides, I'm equipped with an HTML editor with features I'm only beginning to unravel.  So I've been to the forums ""or fora if you're Latin"" and asked for some advise regarding what I should do  to add more dynamism  for a rather largely-allocated webspace which I'm hardly utilizing.  How I was received was close to being fodder in the lion's den, not that I don't take criticism too well...especially the constructive kind. I welcome them with an open mind as a matter of fact.  To site an example, I can't seem to readily forget a comment such as ""some retarded flash movie embedded in an HTML document"" referring to my Splashpage --- which, from the thread's conversation, indicated that the little flash animation I used for adorinareyes.com was in fact NOT showing up on most browsers.  So I've been prompted to remove the flash animation and decided on pure unadulterated white text on a black background for it to be more accessible especially to Mozilla users.  Later on, I'd like to turn it back into something  flash-like  but until I find someone or some good program to do it for me, my ""simple text splashpage"" will have to stay and ferment.    Next, I was struck by the comment on ""streamlining the look"" because my website looks kind of like a hodge-podge of unrelated events.  Since my running idea was and still is  Webcapage , this means I can literally do whatever I like with every page (in terms of design and approach) although I believed his point with ""making my website more useable"" pretty much hit home.   The result was uniforming the layout and navigation buttons on all pages except the Screensavers Set which is autonomous as it is.  So this is what you see for now --- no more animated gifs looping in an endless cycle in AdVentures although quite frankly, I miss my little sha-k!  Colored text remains as it was created back in 1997.  Minor improvements all in all in terms of layout and design.  As egotistical as it may sound, Rome after all...wasn't built in a day.

Sooo, this is why I love summer. I get home, get out of the heat and into my air conditioned apartment. I can take a nap, watch TV, do whatever I want. Instead of stressing over some stupid paper or worrying about statistics. Thank God for summer, I think it keeps grad students sane.    As for the girl who died, she had an eating disorder....which is really sad. I can't believe the way some people go. Its completely unnecessary, being thin, being rich, any of the above is not worth your life. Its scary how dangerous  destructive our perspective can be to our own livelihood. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies.    I am getting ready to go on a run, the sun is setting  its beinning to cool off.  Evan is getting ready to come over  cook dinner, then we are going to watch TV or a movie. I think its wonderful to enjoy time with other people. Its like we spend almost all of our time with other people because we have to (work, school, etc.) its just nice to do it because we want to, or we enjoy their company. yada, yada, yada....oh, did i mention i have a headache? must not be drinking enough water....hmmmm...how much do you REALLY have to drink?!?	f

today went to have lunch with vincent and groups... shouldn't have been there or maybe i should... cause we saw ee kheng with her boyfriend, holding hands together... why i shouldn't have been there because i don't know what and how to react... why i should be there because i don't want vincent they all to keep things from me, i don't like the feelings when friends hide something from me...  i guess she didn't saw us... but i was very uneasy... maybe because of the way they tease me, but come to think of it again,maybe i really care about her... is it because thethingy is still going on so i have tobe concernor becausei really like her? i took some time to calm down... ponder over it... ya, i think i have a crush on her...   but wait... then i took time to think again...doubts was somehow cleared, i guess i just paid too much attention on her because of the thingy... i'm just over-reacting... false alarm... *phew*	m
Doctor cure me what is the cause of my condition? This madness shoots me like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie.	m
I tried drinking one tablet. I wanted to see whether it really was going to make me more energetic. It was quite effective. I took it in the morning, then I was still wide awake and alert at around 5pm. That is a feat for me. I tend to become sluggish around 3-5 pm; my body starts craving for siesta around that time. So anyway, I was able to work more. I think that energy was sustained till around 8pm. Then I became my usual sleepy self at 9-10. I should take Rogin-E more often.	f
Check this out - from the  Weekly International Outlook , April 7, 2003:	m
For the last day and a half, our company had phone  problems. A phone technician came in today...this Chinese guy with a thick  accent. Our assistant to the CEO was having a very hard time understanding  anything he was saying, so I translated...and it reminded me of how my  experiences have honed my skills in understanding broken English.  It makes me think about what it would be like if I were fluent  in Korean. Chances are, fluency in Korean would have greatly decreased the  number of times I was in situations where I had to decipher broken  English. I wonder if that would have left me as clueless as my co-worker.  And I also wonder if somehow, my heightened ability to  understand broken English and body language will help me to communicate with  more people than if I were fluent in Korean...since I canunderstand all  broken English...not just Korean broken English...it could just go a long way.	m

The word of the day kids is POOP. Unbelievable, amazing, nuclear milk chocolate fondue poop. I have finally found something that can make Mark gag courtesy of the diaper offerings of a two year old.  Friday afternoon Mark and I were watching the neighbors little tornado John.  You can tell he adores Mark. He will sit with Mark and do nothing for an hour or more. He won't do that for me or anyone else. It is damn cute to watch the two of them.  Well, Mark and John were sitting in the music room playing with Mark's new digital mixing board. I stopped in to check on them. As we were talking both my nose and Mark's detected an indescribable stench. On investigation and much sniffing about the culprit was identified. The stench was emanating from the back side of a certain little boy. If we knew the stench was bad, but we had no clue what we were in for.  I went to do a diaper check and quickly found my fingers covered in milk chocolate, oh my god this stinks, poop. Let's just say I finally found the cure for nail biting. Since that moment I have washed by hands multiple times, applied rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxoide, and my fingers have not come near my face.   So I carried, at arms length, John to the bathroom where I removed his poop staind shirt and pants. Oh my god!  You know how on the side of the diaper box it says 10 to 12 pounds.  Well kids, I am here to tell you that is exactly all they will hold. Not one ounce more. This kid had loaded this diaper so full it was bulged out to his knees and poo was seeping out the top and bottom. I had no desire to remove it.  If it had been summer time I would have hauled that kid into the yard and hit him with the hose. I had Mark open all the doors, open the trash can lid, and clear a path.  Once he hollered the all clear I scooped up the kid, at arms length, and hauled him and his deadly butt out to the trash can. As soon as I got that nuclear waste containing diaper off that kids behind, Mark began gaging, choking and spitting. The poor mans eyes were watering and his nose was running.  I dang near fell over laughing and holding my nose. Of course John thought it was all funny as heck and was giggling like only a two year old can.  The rest is pretty boring. Once again I scooped up our foul smelling, giggling little friend - at arms length - and off to the bath tub we went.  Got stink boy all cleaned up. Needless to say, I think it will take a while before I can bring up having a brat of our own because of this. Mark has no desire to encounter such a diaper again.  :o)	f
Just a man   Before you judge me... Before you call me a slut... Before you hate me... remember that I am just a man.   I don't know who I am, but I know what I enjoy. time with friends, time reading my books, time spent self improving, these are some of the things I enjoy most. Travel, meeting new friends, watching a well made film, talking, kissing.  Thinking about the un-important things in life. Why are we here? What happens when we die? Is God real? Is there life after death? Is there a soul? Things that can really only be carefully considered after the basic needs are taken care of.  Lively debate with friends in a trusted environment.  These are the things I cherish, these are what make me a man...	m
"All-in-one wonders  Jul 15 2004  By The Huddersfield Daily Examiner    So where does Justin Hawkins get his catsuits? JENNY PARKIN talked to the woman who knows his inside leg measurements!  WHENEVER The Darkness return from a tour, Justin Hawkins' clothes designer is in tears.  For those beautiful catsuits come back ripped, stained and sweaty.  ""They're always in a terrible state,"" says Lucy Manning. ""I just cry and cry.""  She's made about 30 sparkly all-in-ones for the singer, who studied at Huddersfield Technical College before he found fame.  And his startling, sartorial statements have become a real trademark for the band.  ""Everyone expects to see him wearing something really flamboyant now,"" says Lucy, 26. ""They'd be disappointed if he didn't.""  She has known Justin's brother Dan, bassist with The Darkness, since they were both teenagers.  Both Lucy - who goes out with Allan Stewart, the guitarist from indie band Idlewild - and the famous brothers come from the seaside town of Lowestoft, in Sussex.  She went to London to study fashion in London and established herself in the pop world, assisting a designer, William Baker, who dressed the likes of Kylie, Jamiroquai and Garbage.  ""Yes, he put Kylie in hotpants,"" says Lucy. ""And he did the clothes for the videos to Can't Get You Out Of My Head and Spinning Around.""  One day, Lucy got a call from Dan, out of the blue - asking her for help with his band's image.  ""I ummed and ahhed for ages,"" says Lucy. ""What they wanted was really theatrical - I didn't know whether I wanted to go down that road. I wasn't sure it was me.""  Finally she met Justin - who's just been voted fourth most important person in rock in a poll by Kerrang! magazine - and the pair began to put together ideas for stunning stagewear.  Lucy says: ""Justin's a sweetheart, on stage he has this persona but in real life he's quiet and shy.  ""We talked things through and it all started to take shape.""  Both were inspired by Mick Jagger's spangly suits of the 70s as well as Freddie Mercury and Elton John's beautiful clothes that had a comical, theatrical edge.  ""In the early days I used to get really cheap Lycra from the market at about 10p a metre,"" says Lucy.  ""But now I have more money to spend we're going more and more luxurious with beautiful, soft glove leather, fake fur and the most gorgeous, expensive fabrics available.""  Lucy draws up the designs with Justin's help and they're actually made by a tailor, Owen Gaster.  ""There's only so many things you can do with a catsuit to keep it sexy - without turning it into a boiler suit or a leotard.  ""And I think Justin's outfits are very sexy.""  Lucy keeps every one of Justin's catsuits, no matter how worn-out they are.  She says she'd love to stage an exhibition of them.  A particular favourite of hers was one made for a high-profile concert supporting Robbie Williams at Knebworth. It was purple and black with a tail - a devil suit.""  A different show stopper was a white and silver all-in-one for an appearance at the MTV awards. ""It was covered in really expensive crystals,"" she says. ""And Justin had a matching guitar strap, too. The whole ensemble cost thousands to make but it was worth it.""  For the Brits, when The Darkness scooped several awards, Justin wore yet another amazing outfit for the show finale - in which he stood atop a big, flashing platform that rose high above the stage.  ""He had this idea that he wanted a mane,"" says Lucy. ""Yet he wanted to look like a fish. A fish with a mane.  ""I was thinking of seahorses when I created this catsuit.""  Lucy was there on the big night. ""It was really exciting,"" she says. ""Justin went on that platform without any safety gear. I was really worried - I wanted him to get a harness on. But he wouldn't. It was such a buzz, he thanked me on stage, which was a nice thought.""  * The Darkness became firm favourites on the rock scene last year with hit singles including I Believe In A Thing Called Love and debut album Permission To Land.  * A festive single, Christmas Time (Don't Let The Bells End) sealed their popularity.  * Some sceptics didn't take their Queen-inspired sound seriously - but their universal appeal means they've had the last laugh.  * All eyes will be on what they do next to top their success so far!"	f

"Yes, I went to the strip club tonight, w/Willis (no, the other willis :)  It was ok, at least there was only one fat chick, instead like last time, when every other chick was fat.  That was fucked up.  No, but tonight, willis had only been to one strip club, so we went tonight, got in free (thanks, military id card), and we played pool, saw the ""sights"".  I thought our waitress was VERY cute, and she was cool, not trying for tips, so that very much appeals to me.  I talked to her a lot (as much as I could), tipped her very well as that is her wages (tips only), and told her I'd be at book a million tomm at 1p.  If she shows, it's all good, if not, it's all good, only I know that god hates me.  But that's a given anyway.  I hope she doesn't think I just tipped  talked cuz I was ""drunk"" because I wasn't.  As of now (only 1.5 long islands after), I have a small buzz.  So I know completely what the fuck I'm doing.  It gave me confidence to set myself up for another fall.  I know that's what's going to happen because god hates me.  The end. There is nothing left to tell.  When tomm falls through like a ton of fucking bricks, that is proof alone that I am god's wasteland.  My life is nothing that has importance to him.  So fuck him.  That's bullshit, and that's life.  Fuck, why do I even waste my time trying when I know that my plans don't mean dick.  If there's some other plan, then GIVE IT TO ME so I can stop wasting my time trying to make MY plans work.  It's bullshit.  It's a waste of my time   energy fucking with them.  d a m m i t."	m
OSCAR PICKS REVIEW   So I guess I didn't do too badly with my picks.  I missed the Lord of the Rings for best picture, and director.  I honestly didn't expect it to win because it is a fantasy film.  It was an excellent film and did deserve to win the award so good for it.  (A little bitter Seabiscuit didn't win though.  I like Seabiscuit. :0 )    As far as best actor goes, I still think Bill Murray deserved to win it.  I didn't see Mystic River, but I find it very hard to believe the Spicoli was the best actor among the five nominated.  Who knows?  Quite frankly who really cares?  My day is no different after the Oscars than it was before.  Just thought picking them could be fun.  Maybe I will have better luck next year.  (Even though four out of seven is not too shabby.)	m
Howdy All! I haven't blogged for a while, and I was going to use for an excuse that I couldn't think of a thing to blog about.  Well, guess what?  That excuse won't fly anymore!   Check out this new site:   urlLink Blogger Seeds   This site is full of ideas!  The topic below is just one of the many ideas found, and new ideas are being added weekly!   A Pet Peeve  Well, I have many pet peeves, but one that I find most annoying is people who drive while talking on their cell phone!  They just are not paying attention to the road.  I have been cut off on US10, cars have pulled out in front of me on busy streets, and on several occasions, I have noticed that these folks were talking on the phone.  When my sister and I drove to GA together there were times when I told  her  not to talk to me, because I needed to concentrate on the signs and traffic!  And she was sitting in the car with me, but when driving on unfamiliar roads and highways, a person needs to concentrate!  Fortunately she understood, and played the part of the navigator.  People using car phones have caused accidents, and I for one, would support a law that bans you from using them while driving.	f

Arnaud is here.  It's been pretty cool so far.  Y'all'll meet him on Monday.  Which reminds me of something...  Loren and Jing have been so difficult lately, at least online.  I can never get a straight answer out of either of them.  And I don't know what the crap has been happening with Jing and Kevin, ooOOoohh.  Mr. Stanley said he would let me retake the test over the weekend, and if I got it all right, he would change my test grade to a B+, and maybe make me take the tests I missed.  This isn't exactly what I was hoping for, but at least my grade will improve.  Maybe.  If anybody wants to do anything with Arnaud and me next weekend, like a movie, let me know.	m

All people are multi-layered--onions, if you will, or parfaits (which Donkey  I are both fans of).  Some people take awhile to warm up to new people, easing into new acquaintanceships slowly, like one might inch into an icy lake.  They aren't unsociable or rude, these folks, they just have a more reserved nature.  Likewise, there are people who will behave amiably enough right away, but prefer to keep things on a slightly superficial level.  They may be very deep on the inside, but they are more comfortable engaging in very light small talk.  Pleasant enough to converse with for a spell, but you don't get a real sense of substance.  Then there are those rare people who, from the first time you meet them, completely engage you.  They cannonball into friendship with unabashed enthusiasm, embracing you with both arms and taking you along for the ride.  From the moment you meet, there are no awkward silences or contrivances.  They insist on seeing right to the messy core of you,  celebrating each quirk along the way, and returning the favor.  They challenge, delight, and stimulate each cell in your brain, and leave your soul feeling overflowing, alive, and happy.  After spending ten minutes in their company, you are already looking forward to the next dozen times you will spend together.   Thank you, A  N!	f
"It's the late 1990s, and this multibillion-dollar financial company hires a consulting outfit to create a Y2k disaster recovery and business continuity plan, reports a pilot fish on the scene.  ""Since the company was regulated by the FDIC, these plans were being audited closely,"" says fish. ""Our team of 10 consultants began by inventorying the 200 most important business processes and identifying the 10 most critical data centers and processing locations.  ""All was going well until one of the IT directors complained to the CIO that we were asking too many questions.""  Turns out the business-side managers have been told everything's all ready for Y2k. And by asking them searching questions, the consultants are raising doubts about the company's Y2k status.  Actually, the Y2k fixes haven't even started. ""Their main financing application had 10 million lines of code, with multiple copies on multiple servers, and multiple copies on the same server,"" fish says. ""No one really knew which objects were actually running in production. Many of the objects either didn't have source code or the source code was dated and didn't match what was in production.  ""Our team was told we were no longer allowed to schedule interviews with anyone in the company. We were instructed to hurry up, assess the risks and finish a detailed plan on how the keep the business running if Y2k caused any application, location or anything else to fail.""  So the 10 consultants spend the next six weeks -- at $1,500 a day each -- with their feet up, deciding the fate of the company. What should the company do if the 3,000 people in the processing center out East loses power? How should they respond to a major outage in a data center with 150 servers supporting 5,000 users? If things get really bad, which divisions and loan portfolios should be sold to other banks if the company can't service them?  ""We were gods with unlimited power,"" says fish.  And while the consulting team is making up business continuity plans out of whole cloth, the Y2k program manager and the CIO continue to report that the whole Y2k project is right on track.  ""Finally, some of the vice presidents and managers started asking how the business continuity plans were being written when no one had even asked them how they ran their divisions,"" says fish.  ""Pressure mounted. Finally the CIO relented and gave us permission to start talking to people again.  ""While we no longer ruled the world and made decisions over life or death of the company, we worked hard and completed the plans and the project successfully.  ""Y2k passed, nothing happened, and I was able to turn in my pager a couple weeks early."""	m

Well, Caden got his first haircut yesterday, but it didn't turn out to be the joyous, memorable event we'll want to remember for years. Poor little man. I asked Chris to give him a haircut because his hair was really getting long over the ears and in the back and, of course, I didn't want my baby to have a mullet! So, Chris buzzed it! It was shorter than I had imagined (shorter than Chris had imagined, too, I think). I was so upset that I made myself sick with tears! He didn't even look like my baby! But, with time I have gotten used to it. Grandma Patty says he looks cute and it's not so bad. He is quite a baldy, though. Thank goodness hair grows back! The worst part was that he was deathly afraid of the buzzer the whole time. He cried through most of it so the haircut/buzz didn't exactly turn out perfect. I couldn't help much because I was too traumatized! I am fine now, though.  My backaches seem to be getting slightly better since I have been using more pillows and a few Tylenol every night. The baby is still kicking, but not all days are active. Sometime S/He just likes to rest. Can't wait to schedule an ultrasound on the 16th of Aug. I really want to know what this baby growing inside me is going to be!	f

"My day was interesting.  I rolled out of bed, I finished   Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs,   By the illustrious Chuck Klosterman.  It's a fascinating book for the VH1 Junkie.  If you know your pop culture shit, you will enjoy this.  If you don't, you will think it is utter and complete garbage.  Later on, after a shower, I did nothing.  Well, not entirely.  I played bass and listened to Franz Ferdinand (who are awesome... by there album.)  I watched Jeopardy, on which this guy has now won over $440,000.  He is unstoppable.  Anyway, later Sarah called.  ""It gon rain."" she said.  and thus, my search for a new recipient of a ravinia ticket began.  After a few failed attempts, I called James Noyes.  And wound up with a bit of an upgrade.  I ended up inside the pavilion.  Ben folds was awesome.  James's family were nice people.  although his brother was really annoying.  He asked a lot of irritating questions.  Not that I'm bitching about free tickets and dinner.  His parents tried to get me to come to an Obama fundraiser.  It was quite amusing.

In the attempt to test out our spanking new message board I wanted to ask your opinion on this.  A while ago now I came up with a plan of getting the whole crew together for some photo shots around the island.  What we would do is get hold of a van for transport and an old Sofa.  We would then proceed to drive round the Island and at Random areas stop, get the sofa out, all sit on it and have a photo taken.  We could do this almost anywhere.  Gory Castle, St Brelades Beach, St Ouens Beach, Middle of Town, Jersey Airport, Faldoet Dolman and so on.   So go to the message board and put down your views.   urlLink Message Link   Danger	m
three days ago, i realized i had what felt to be overenflamed tastebuds all across my tongue... perhaps 3 or 4 in all... or maybe they were kanker sores or something else that i dont even know about...  the point is, i had no idea just how painful these small things would end up becoming... sunday for lunch i took a walk down the beach to the harbor and got a slice of pizza... i was so excited about the pizza... i could smell it cooking... and each bite was a great pain to bear through... every time something just barely skirted across my tongue, i felt it, and with amazing pains... ouch...  hopefully, these sores or whatever they are, are just passing through... and hopefully theyll be gone before i know it...  but in the meantime, it makes it hard to speak even... perhaps this is a time to hold my tongue?... i dunno... but yesterday, holly and i were driving to santa cruz and i got in this phone conversation with someone with whom there had been a miscommunication and boy i lashed out... it was a bad day... i mean, i had peed on my shoe on accident earlier that day... but instead of listening, i just lashed out...  listen, ryan, listen...  so, we all love to talk, me especially, but perhaps when you become in a social setting 'the talker' then its hard to hear others' perspectives... feeling like you want to be understood, you talk a little more to make sure you are being understood, when the other person just wants to be understood and validated as well...  this was to be my week of listening... tomorrow i am going to san fransisco to see a friend who is a kind of spiritual director for me... kind of a rabbi... and today i am with my in-laws... listen, ryan, listen... i will try...	m

urlLink The Jamestown Foundation   I would like to take issue with several assertions made by Dr. You Ji in his article “ China’s Post 9/11 Terrorism Strategy” (The Jamestown Foundation. www.Jamestown.org 15/04/04) especially as they regard the issue of Uygur “terrorism” in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region in China..  In his article Dr Ji states that  “ China has not been free from transnational terrorist acts, with some Chinese minorities spurred into armed protest against the central government by ethnic separatism, Islamic fundamentalism and al-Qaeda's networks.”  He goes on to say   “..insurgents” for Xinjiang independence (Jiangdu) have launched successive attacks to destabilise Chinese rule since the late 1980s.”  Let us look at these totally unfounded statements. Firstly, that the Uygur as a people have been “spurred” into “armed protests” against the Han Chinese Government. Dr Ji’s choice of words would have the reader believe that the Uygur people as a whole are engaged in a continuing sizeable armed conflict with the Han Chinese with a view to destabilising Han rule. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  It is true that a majority of Uygurs consider the Han presence in Xinjiang/East Turkestan as being a colonial occupation. They believe that Han policies are detrimental to them as the indigenous peoples and that they are discriminated against as to race and religion. They also believe that it is the objective of Han policy to destroy Uygur culture to facilitate assimilation of the Uygur ethnicity into the Chinese nationality.  It is not true however that the Uygur people, as a whole or even in majority, support armed insurrection as a means of throwing off the yoke, as they see it, of Chinese rule. Yes, they would in their hearts long to see a free “East Turkestan” that is without doubt just as the Tibetans hold similar dreams. In that sense then they can be viewed as “separatists”. But holding a dream of “separation” from China and actually having the will or ability to enter into armed insurrection to achieve it is quite another thing.  Dr Ji’s asserts, rather poetically, that the Uygur are “spurred” on also, in whatever they are supposed to be doing, by “Islamic fundamentalism” as well as by association with the ubiquitous al Qaeda network. He then goes on to say that the Uygur and al Qaeda share common ideological goals.   I wonder if the good Doctor has actually ever been to Xinjiang or even seen any pictures of Uygurs? The Uygur people are Muslim predominantly, that is without question, but they are Sunni Muslims and adhere to the Hanafi school of Islam that is renowned for its moderation and liberalism. It bears now relation whatsoever to the “brand” of Islam followed by the likes of the fundamentalist Taliban of Afghanistan fame or al Qaeda.  One only has to look at pictures of Uygur woman to see that fundamentalism is not an issue in Xinjiang. Generally they dress very much in a western style with make up and jewellery. Whilst a majority will wear a head scarf there are very few who wear a hijab that is a basic dress form of Islamic fundamentalism.  As well alcohol is used in moderation by some Uygur which is something that certainly would not be tolerated in a fundamentalist society. I do not believe anyone with even a little knowledge of the Uygur would call them “fundamentalists” or believe they are “spurred” on in anything they do by “ Islamic fundamentalism”  Then Dr Yi claims the Uygur have an ideological brotherhood with al Qaeda and share common goals. Again nothing could be further from the truth. The Uygur, unlike al Qaeda, are by and large, pro western and pro American. They look to the west to support them and many consider their so called “Muslim brothers’ in Central Asia and throughout the Arab states to have failed to offer them support. It is common sense, China is an economic lure for the central Asians and for the Arab world the “enemy of my enemy is my friend”.   So ”Separatism”, “Islamic fundamentalism” and associations with al Qaeda ”spur” blighted Uygur to “successive” attacks on the mighty Han regime to “destabilise” it? I do not know what Dr Yi understands the word ‘successive” to mean but for mine it is acts following one after another with the inference of a close time frame. Without going in to a detailed rebuttal of the Doctor’s statement I can not see the very limited number of violent actions perpetrated by the Uygur against the Han since 1949 or even since the 80’s as being “successive” What has been independently verified, as distinct to what the Chinese Government claim, could in nobody’s terms be called “successive’ with all the implications that choice of word entails. At best violence being perpetrated by Uygur on Han has been extremely sporadic since 1949, of little real consequence and hardly what one could call organised or “successive” to the degree one would expect from “professional” terrorists organisations.  Dr Yi also characterises this so called “Uygur terrorism” as having a well defined programme built on base networks at” home and abroad” and that they are able to elicit a positive response from the general population.  Anyone with the vaguest understanding of the Uygur will know that if they have one problem as a people in all their dealings with the Han Communists is that they are not able to rally and organise effectively. Many commentators have remarked that it is due to a lack of common purpose and shared “identity” that has hampered the Uygur in achieving any positive concessions from China.  I am sure that Dr Yi should know that the concept of “Uygur” as a ”nationality” is something that existed for a short period in the 8th and 9th centuries CE with the Uygur Orkhan empire, but, went out of vogue with the Uygurss move to present day Xinjiang from Mongolia. It was only resurrected as a concept by “Uygur’ intellectuals in the late 19th century. Even as late as the 1960’s you were a Kashgarlik before you were an Uygur.  This lack of identity and common purpose makes it impossible for the Uygur to become organised with a well “defined programme” of action let alone “terrorism”. Since the short lived East Turkestan Republic (that by the way only held sway over 25% of the Uygur population in it’s short history) the Uygur have been unable to throw up from their midst any person or group to take on the mantle of “Uygur” leadership.  There are no organised Uygur “terrorist” groups active in Xinjiang, at least not to the degree a casual reader would think from perusing the Doctor’s article. There is no “Pan Turkism” (it is a rather outmoded concept since the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the Soviet Union) There are no organised terrorist organisations outside Xinjiang either. There is, full stop, no such thing as an “Uygur terrorist organisation” as the world understands the concept.  I can not prove that something does not exist but someone writing as the doctor has written is bound to backup his assertions with at least a modicum of factual data and not rely seemingly on information gleaned from Chinese propaganda or the likes of the “People’s Daily” or “Xinhua” the news organs of the Chinese Communist Party.  Two things in closing, every commentator in the world, bar Dr Yi, agrees that the Han Chinese are now at least at parity with the Uygur in terms of population numbers if not significantly ahead. Not, as Dr Yi infers by his use of outdated data (2000 census figures are out) that the Han are a minority in Xinjiang.   Finally I do agree wholeheartedly with Dr Yi that the Chinese have done quite well out of the “War On Terror”	m

I am coming rather late to this blogging thing.  In fact I hadn't taken much interest in it at all until my good friend  urlLink Ariel  started one.  I had of course read a few months ago that the only way to get a oh-so-sought-after Gmail account was to have an account on Blogger. I have yet to get my invite by the way.  But, after having explored a number of blog sites I came to the conclusion that Blogger did offer some versatility that others didn't, so here I am.  A couple of days ago I found probably the most addictive web page ever encoded by human beings,  urlLink Blogger's Recently Updated Blogs . Oh this was intoxicating. It listed the last 10 minutes or so of all the blogs on Blogger that had just been updated. The screen has been blank for the last couple of days and it has been driving me bats.  First of course there is the fact that I can't see who's posting out there.  Then there is the fact that there may have been thousands upon thousands of people reading  THIS  blog from that page.  Oh, well, I suppose I will have to go back to something more conventional, like surfing  urlLink Ariel's  comments pages.	m

"Robert Anton Wilson doesn't just write ""fiction.""  He also has a book called ""Everything is Under Control:  Conspiracies, Cults, and Cover-Ups"" which is sort of an encyclopedia of, as the titles suggests, conspiracies, cults, and cover-ups.  Here's an interesting entry.  According to this entry, I need to call these people.  The words in the brackets, [] are my responses, not part of the article.   Abductees Anonymous   This organization serves as a support group for persons who believe that extraterrestrials have kidnapped and sexually molested them -- one of the largest subgroups in the   recovered memory   community, trailing behind only the   incest survivors   and the   Satanic abuse   survivors.  While the whole theory and therapy of the ""recovered memory"" movement has come under increasing criticism in recent years, it still has many believers, who sincerely think they their therapists helped them remember (not fantasize) incidents of incest, cannibalism, coprophilia, sadomasochism, rape, infant sacrifice, and/or evil   Greys   -- a race of detached scientific investigators and/or sexual monsters who come from outer space and have engaged in genetic experiments or sexual assault on helpless humans.  AbAnon says nothing about the incest and satanism yarns, also created or discovered by the same hypnotic techniques, but insists that ""many millions"" have had the abduction experience and even if you can't personally remember it -- or  especially  if you can't remember it -- this interstellar rape may have happened to you.  They have a list of 52 symptoms that will help you decide if indeed it did happen to you.  A few significant signs from this list:  -- Have unusual scars or marks with no possible explanation on how you received them, especially if you have an emotional reaction to them (i.e., small scoop indentation, straight line scar, scars in roof of mouth, in nose, behind or in ears, or genitals, etc.).  -- Have a cosmic awareness, an interest in ecology, environment, or vegetarianism, or are very socially conscious.  [Yes, on parts of that.]  -- Have inexplicably strong  fears or phobias (i.e., heights, snakes, spiders, large insects, certain sounds, bright lights, your personal security, or being alone.).  [Yes, sorta, I wouldn't call them inexplicably strong, just normal.]  -- Have the feeling of being watched much of the time, especially at night.  [No, but I often like to imagine people are secretly watching my life, like ""The Truman Show,"" or something.]  -- Have awoken with a soreness in your genitals, which cannot be explained.  [Ummm, not unexplained, no.]  -- Have seen a hooded figure in or near your home, especially next to your bed.  [Nope.]  -- Have had frequent or sporadic ringing in your ears, especially in one ear.  [All the time, but lots of people do.]  -- Have insomnia or sleep disorders that are puzzling you.  [I sleep too much.  I guess that would be considered a sleep disorder.]  -- Have the feeling that you are going crazy for even thinking about these sorts of things.  [No, I just think this list is stupid.]  -- Have had a difficult time trusting other people, especially authority figures.  [Who in this modern world doesn't?]  -- Have had dreams of destruction or catastrophe.  [Dreams: Not really.  Fantasies: Yes.]  -- Have many of these traits but can't remember anything about an abduction or alien encounter.  [Yes.  Though I did see a UFO once, but I have never been abducted that I know of.]  Those who have these stigmata or most of them might contact Abductees Anonymous through the website below.  On the other hand, many of the same (or similar) signs may indicate that you are another incest survivor or Satanic abuse survivor; better consult those entries, too.  Can't be too careful these days.   urlLink http://www.CyberGate.com/~ufonline    Ok, so that's it for the article.  Not that I don't believe in Aliens or anything, I do, but this looks pretty stupid to me.  That list of ""symptoms"" consists mostly of things that nearly everyone experiences, at least occasionally.  Especially that list of fears thing.  Of course, they explain that the reason these are so common is because this has happened to millions of people.  Yeah, I doubt it.  Though they may be on to something.  However I doubt it is Aliens doing all this.  It's probably some earthly group or government experimenting on people, and then starting cover-up organizations like these so the few people who do figure out they are being experimented on will think that it is the work of aliens, and also become classified as crazies who no one will take seriously.

Remember I said I was a 27 year-old lounge singer wannabe? Yesterday morning, while Papa Carl and I were on our way to work, I saw this sign posted along one of the streets we normally pass through - Center for Pop Music #234-1120. Unbeknownst to Papa Carl, my eyes began to twinkle like those of a little kids who had just discovered where mommy hid the cookie jar. I could practically hear the wheels in my head turning, Theres a Center for Pop Music here in Cebu? Cool! Quick  better memorize the number discreetly before we make a right turn!  So as my driver was smoking his way into oblivion, I was hatching my own plans for stardom.  Why not? I had just finished my MBA (sans the thesis) and my weekends are practically devoted to purely hedonistic pursuits. Plus, Im reeaally potentially the next Regine Velasquez trapped in a bankers body. Really.  Although my singing experience is mostly limited to intermittent videoke sessions, Ive had my public singing debut during my brothers wedding reception in May last year where I did a more-than-decent rendition of Zoom with my equally aspiring diva of a sister.  I dont think our audience really understood what we were zooming about but the robust claps afterwards more than made up for the late nights my sister and I spent belting out the song over and over again.

Seeing as I am officially on vacation as of 4 pm yesterday, I feel it is my duty - being such a good friend, and all - to gloat about the fact that I am currently slacking off at home, while the rest of you slog through exams...^_-  Anyway, just thought I would share that happy thought with you all!  Mulanda - no te procupes, estoy disfrutando MUCH�SIMO de mis vacaciones.  Buena suerte.	f
I could tell when someone was thinking about me. I knew when they spoke of me. My ears would burn. My head would pound. They are all watching me. But what for? Am I a threat to them? Are they a threat to me? They even speak my name. Usually when I am by myself. That way no one else can hear them in my head. It would get loud. Really loud. I could sometimes not hear others speak. The lights would flicker but only I would notice. Distractions they liked. Making my hands look different. Making people think differently of me. And the yelling... I was always being yelled at. Not by family. The teacher. She was always yelling. I would think something and she would yell at me like I said it out loud. She knows what's going on. But the pain. This spot on my head would kill. And then it would move to different parts of my head. My fingers were always numb. Then my hands. They would tingle alot. I saw it behind the pipes. The eyes. Watching me. Why can't they just leave? But where would they go? They took my emotion. I cannot feel sadness. Sometimes I dream of the future. I know this because the dreams come true. My potatos tasted funny that night. My mother - My own mother! - had put something in them taste minty. I cant remember the rest of the night. All black. I dont remember to eat. I no longer feel hunger. I have to remember to eat just to stay alive. I dont want to die you know. I will never die. They can't make me. No one else can see them. They dont let them. They want control. Thats all they want is control. But no me. No, they will never control me. Never. My mind will blow them away. But I cannot let them know this. I have to shut down. Build a wall of brick. I don't even like pudding that much. And the thoughts make no sense. They come to me at the speed of light. They don't relate to each other. I get looked at funny because of this. Nobody understands my thoughts. I can make sense out of them but no one else can. It leaves the world to suffer without my knowledge. If only they all knew what I know. Boy! What a world we could have!	f

"Ok I know this is going to sound like an Allie rant, but I'm going crazy again.  Carl was being such a jerk.   I tell him that ""I'm gonna stay until I find someone better"".. ""Until you find someone better huh?""  ""Ya until someone better says leave him, I'm stayin put.""  No response.. I wanna kill him somedays.  Brian is an emotional wreck.  I've been so horny there is nothing that is working.  I gotta get this female out of my head before I got out to iowa.  I really don't wanna do that.  If that's what it takes.  I can't handle this anymore.  If you guys all thought I was a whore when I lived at Star's you ain't seen nothing yet.. It's like I've gone in to heat or something.  It's totally uncontrolable.  Even when I do get it it's VERY good but i'm still just ok.  I mean I know it's awesome.  I'm never knocking Brian for being bad in bed.  I would be lying.  It;s not him at all.  My sex drive is through the roof right now.  This moon cycle is very rough on me i'm goin to be happy to see it go.  Matt has made me realize that I have not had a woman since Cher was out back in July.  Now I'm really craving her.. This is SOOOOO not a good thing!  What the hell is wrong with me?  I think about it 24-7.  I'm starting to day dream about it in the car.  I mean it's not like I'm afraid to be with another woman or anything.  She's not even all that great in bed.. I meean she's good but not AWESOME.  I think that's my problem the only awesome one I've had that's curbed my appetite is Allison and for what ever reason she's not interested anymore.  I think Jim has brainwashed her to not having energy about anything.  I want my best friends back.  I think Me allison and Gloria should all just get an apartment together.. Me and allison share a bedroom.  That's it.  I miss my best friends.  I know life goes on but why are we all stuck in these dead end relationships and all of us are just DONE.  I mean really done.  If I could take my two best friends with me and move us all in the same place together i think I would be in heaven.  I would finally really be at peace.  Allison would be happy without jim.  Gloria would be happy without Steve.  I'd be happy as long as I could be with allison or gloria and not be with brian.. Before you flip Glor that might not have sounded right.  I really don't feel like over explaining myself but since I just opened up a can I might as well whoop ass on it huh?  In Katy's perfect world Gloria would make steve take fucking responsibility for once in his whole pathetic life and just leave Allison would really realize that she's just ok but not happy by far and CONSTANTLY broke ecause of bad decision HE's made. I would realize that I really am just settling. We'd all move out move in together in to a big 2 bedroom. Be each other's support. Start over.. Do the next 30 years right. Find me a woman that I can be happy with (but that's too much to ask) A booty call that doesn't treat me like a piece of shit (but that's too much to ask) then again this is my perfect world"	f
I just had a talk with my boss and I finally told her about the real situation of my life...I was relieved after that talk and I had 2 things that I would do starting next week: -      1. spend more time with my dad   2. fix myself      I'll be taking a leavecome Monday, and it may take a week or two...but allI want to do is just be with my dad...spend more time with him...do things wenever did before...we'll just be carefree and happy...and at the same time, I would be able to relax myself...unwind...and have a great time with my dad...we'll clear our minds from all the worries and stress and just enjoy life together...and I believethis would help us have a clearer view to where we are heading to and to slowly embrace reality...	f
"•Mood: pessimistic       •Music: Dire Straits - Romeo  Juliet (bad, I know)   Why is this finding a decent job proving so difficult? I turned down a part-time, slave labor, work-out-of-a-home-office, set-up-my-accounting-from-scratch position today. The guy was an arrogant cheapskate but he did have one good line, ""It was a halfway house and we're turning it into a bar/nightclub."" I have never heard Scottsdale summed up so succinctly.

Hehe, the first day without Matt for a while and I break down.  I knew this would happen.  I can't stand the thought of not having him there to talk to, especially now since he means so much more to me than ever.    I logged online today and found an e-mail from him.  I love getting e-mails from him.  But unfortunately, this one wasn't filled with awesome metaphors and a good message.  This e-mail was filled with two zipped conversations.  From the very first to the most recent (and hopefully not the very last).  Which I guess was nice.  But I wanted a message from him.  Sigh.  12 MB.  Wow.  Since June 17th, 2003.  To July 10th, 2004.  A year.  And more.  I told Amanda about us today.  And that felt good.    Anyway, about the Simpsons.  Today, the episode was really touching and it made me tear up a little bit.  It was about when Homer was a young kid.  He was sent to camp where they made him work.  At camp, Homer met this girl and they shared their first kiss under the stars.  And after that, he didn't see her again.  She was heart broken.  And so was he.  Well, it turns out that the girl was Marge.  And so in the end, they did get back together again.  Without knowing their previous romance.  And I found that very touching.    Its something I would want someday with Matt.  But that road is filled with many many bad parts.  Pain.  And tears.  But in the end, is it worth it?  It is.    Other than that, I'm randomly tearing up whenever I think of Matt and how he's moving away.  Hopefully it'll get better.  Soon.  Also, I might be going away the two weeks he's home.  Which is bad since the last time I saw him (yesterday) we didn't get any alone time.  Which I need before he leaves.  To have him hold me one last time.  Lets hope this all works out.  Hope.  Sigh.	m
So, my reason for creating this blog was not, in fact, to declare my love of earwigs.  I actually don’t even like them very much (with the exception of that whole cerci thing).  I’ve been told that I can be very negative at times.  While I don’t always think this is true, I’d rather not burden my friends with my lamentations.  It’s so nice to be able to express yourself – get it out there – and not have to own up to it.  Doing it secretly is so much more kind.   My first tirade will be about my lack of rational thought.  I am like a child sometimes, wanting instant gratification, and not always thinking things through to the end.  I’ve done this again just recently.  I’ve interviewed for a part-time job and they’ve offered it to me.  Great!  Except now I’m wondering if I can actually afford not to be working full-time.  I should have thought more about this ahead of time, right?  hmmm…	f
I was discussing with my roommate the amount of parting we do.  We estimated out of 52 Fridays a year, we are probly out 48 of those 52.  Plus, we usually have a vendor meet once a week, thats another 58 times of those per year...  Plus we go out a couple of Saturdays a year.  That totlas about 144 days we are out per year.  Then consider doubling that for the hang-over days. Thats 288 days.  Jeeze, here we go again!  Off to the country bar!!	m
"next discussion>>   rate this post  Thanks for telling me I don't need therapy! I am glad someone else feels the same way I do about it. Your message was comforting. I am feeling a lot better the past couple of days. You are right, I don't have any ""real"" reason to go to therapy, I am happy, my relationship is healthy, and my husband is wonderful, and things are going well otherwise. The only thing that I Was thinking of going for was the overwhelming guilt I feel because of my exposure to militant feminism. It came upon me the other day like a ton of bricks because I was overbusy and overtired. One of the haunting things that overwhelms me with guilt is that I am going back to school. Should be a good thing, but the truth is, is that if I was not with my husband, I would not be in school. It was always something I wanted to do, but I never was like those people that had to have it to be a worthy human being. I always thought, if I ever get to do it, then fine, if not fine. I am successful with or without it. When I moved in with my husband, one door opened after another. I Was able to return to an old employer and work only part time, and registered for classes. I am going for a bachelor's degree, and it is a very heavy load. Honestly, I would not be doing it if not for living with my husband, because if I were living alone, I would be working full time and worrying about supporting myself. So in a way, I feel like I am cheating by having his support. I do help with the household bills, however, we hardly have any bills. We are debt free, cars and all. The financial support I get from my husband, however, is extremely minor compared to the support he gives me verbally, mentally, spiritually, and intellectually with college. He even gets into what I am studying and learns it himself. I'll be sitting at my desk studying one book, and he'll be accross from me studying another of my books. There have been times when I have freaked out, announced that I was going to get a full time job, and quit school, just because it's so hard to shed that mindset that you're useless if a man helps you. My husband has even tutored me in algebra. I don't like the mindset that all men want is their wives to be barefoot, pregnant, illiterate, and confined ot the house. My husband would have never married me if I Was like that. He is totally NOT the stereotypical abusive man. He's a great guy, and a great best friend. He makes it clear to me on a regular basis that he is not only proud of me, but that he wants to be like me, and that I don't have any obligation to him for money or sex, or anything like that. (We have sex, but you know what I mean). Today we were talking, and the subject came up of him going back to school when I am finished. It makes me soooooooooo relieved to think about switching ""roles"" with him in a few years. It would really help in making me feel less guilty about me being in school now. Have me be the main breadwinner and him the student. I am so excited about that, and can't wait. It will not only make things even, but my husband is a genius and *should* go to school. He's a mechanic now, but is thinking of majoring in either aerospace engineering or interior design. It's ultimately up to him, but I am rooting for the aerodynamics thing. There was a great thread about feminism on the stay at home or work debate. It was under ""question of the week"" and entitled, ""Generational feminism"". Reading it was very ""kewl"". For once, a discussion about feminism without nastiness, sarcasm, and complete intolerance of someone not agreeing. (Well, there was some, but for the most part, the thread made me feel a lot better about things). The women discussed differences between the older feminists (50's and 60's) being more about insisting women work, while the younger ones (25-40's) making feminism about having the choice of working or not. I never thought about the age of feminists being the difference in that whole metamorphasis. I always scratched my head as to why the old feminists in my life were so much the former, while the ones on the internet were so much the latter. Maybe their age is the reason. It makes a lot of sense. A lot of people insist that women ""back then"" didn't have choices to go out and work. I always wonder, who set it into place to NOT give them choices? Was it the law? Men? The previous generation? I feel like my mother when saying this, but ""WHO'S *THEY*?"" There's a popular saying that no one can make you inferior without your consent. I believe that these women did have choices all along, just didn't want to accept it. Or didn't know. Or just wanted to complain. Besides, all my great grandmothers worked. So they obviously had choices. By the way, I like the term ""Texas transplant"". Yes, and I am proud of it. Believe me, when I moved here, I didn't know that left wingers were going to hold ALL Texans responsible for GW. Please. I know that that's what was behind that comment. Might I remind you that we had a march for women's lives here. And not all of us like Bush. Remember the Dixie Chicks? Take care, and thanks for the reply. ~Danielle~ Y'all com back now, you hear? :D"	f

"We're a  jazz band based in SF . Our song ""Cal's Pals"" is in the L.E.A.R. soundtrack. I wrote this tune in the mid-'90s, inspired by the music of Bay Area vibraphone player, the late Cal Tjader. I put in a favorite lick from Cal's tune  Mambo Mindoro  into my tune. In our tune it's the guitar/marimba lick at the end of the guitar solo section of the tune. Echo Beach has performed this tune dozens of times in the past 10 years and just last Sunday I was told at a gig that it's the favorite tune of some people who  buy our CD . This month (May 2004) has been the most surprising and amazing month in our band's 13-year history. Our music was used in a documentary, we are proud to be included in the L.E.A.R. soundtrack, and KGO Radio played our recording of A.C. Jobim's ""Wave"" last week. I will be attending L.E.A.R. with my wife Sharon on Friday 5/28. Shouts out to Bay Area musicians who are carrying on the great musical tradition here. - Blair Helsing, bandleader, Echo Beach"	m
"When asked yesterday by reporter Ron Burgundy, JD Ironmonger was questioning his ability to play soccer, including the position of goalkeeper, his specialty. However, that all changed today when the Ironman was keeper for basically the whole time in a full field scrimmage today. Coach Bret Weaver had this to say to him, ""I'm looking for you to be varsity keeper. You're the best goalie I've ever seen."" JD got his confidence back by actually trying and just having fun, both for the first time this season. ""I'm ready to win a state championship,"" JD said afterwards."	m

"My Reflections...  I watched our members during the Lord's Supper Today.  As we finished singing about Amazing Love as if we were a people totally unamazed by that love, I was struck by how badly we have allowed ourselves to be crippled by a world more amazed by the sight of the blood given, than by the offer of the blood giver.  As words were recited about the life of David - a man after God's own heart - we pursued the desires of our hearts and minds as we tuned out the voice of the speaker.  The text read, the prayer said, we passed the bread.  As we silently partook of a ""communal"" meal, even the sound of cracker cracking on metal was muffled as much as possible.  A tray was passed down one row in my line of sight, and after it passed, I heard the familiar, ""pffftt....."" of a bottled soft drink opening and carbonation escaping.  For one Christian, the refreshment of a coke chased the dryness of the un-risen bread that reminds us of a risen savior.   The bitterness of the sacrifice Christ made to satisfy our greatest need, followed by the world's cheap answer to our need for temporary relief.  What a contrast.  And that contrast describes our attitude in worship.  We seek our own comfort while we ""celebrate"" our leader because he DID NOT seek his own comfort.  To sing with vigor would require energy...not comfort.  To be truly amazed at His love would require contemplation...not comfort.  To encourage each other during the meal would require vulnerability...not comfort.  It seems that our battle cry in the fights over worship and style has always involved finding what our members are comfortable with.  Well...I'm not comfortable with seeking our own comfort..."	m
"Behind schedule with this thing as usual.  So Sunday was a pretty good day, work flew by really fast.  I was busy between cleaning the place, keeping everything stocked, and working the cash drawer.  Then I rushed home to shower and get ready for Sam, Justinn, and Ben's graduation party.  But first, I had to wrap my Dad's Father's Day gift.  I wanted to just put it on their bed so he could see if alone, not in front of everyone.  What I had done was write him a letter thanking him for all the ways he's made this year and the past 18 so great for me.  That morning I had also gone through one of our photo albums and picked out a picture of him and I from when I was about 1 or 2 years old and then I framed it in this distressed frame.  Going through that album was tough though.  It was the first time I really showed a lot of emotion over leaving to go to school.  I realized I'd miss my family, to some degree anyway.  I started to cry pretty hard, looking through all those pictures.  But in a way it was nice, I hadn't been reflecting the way everything's made me feel - graduation, no tears - and so it was a good release of some feelings.  I really needed that.  Anyway, after I prepared the gift I got ready and went to the party.  Since I'd worked all day I'd missed most of the party and everyone was mostly gone but I stayed for a bit and talked to everyone.  Then everyone went their own seperate ways.  Alex and I started watching ""Bowling for Columbine"" but I fell asleep! (for the nine thousanth time we've been together).  So we stopped it and it was an early night, I was asleep by like 11 on my floor because my bed is still covered in stuff to put away in my room.  Swim class today was super exhausting.  I got really frustrated carrying this guy through water.  It was very difficult to hold one of those buoyant guard things and a 200+ pound guy in my arms and swim.  It was just too big an armful.  But it feels good to workout this way, I like this tired feelin although it sucks because I have no energy after class.  One of the girls in the class is so sweet and we're starting to bond.  I was so happy because she actually had heard of AU! She knew where it was and everything.  Most people haven't because it's pretty small.  So that was a nice thing.  After I came home though, I showered, ate and completely crashed on the couch for like 4 hours.  I was so exhausted.  Tonight we finally watched the movie.  It definitely made me think about a lot of different things.  I think the director did a great job of encompassing many different angles of the issue.  So yeah.  Now that I've had my nap I'm real awake but I should try to get some sleep anyway.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better, today was pretty good but I still feel like I'm not getting everything into the day that I want to.  Oh well, it's time to sleep."	f

"I'm busy working out which alternative transport fuel and technologies show the most promise in greenhouse gas and air pollution emission reduction within a decade at the moment – so many variables, I think my head has gone pop at least twice this week.  So in procrastinating I thought I best stick to something at least a little related…a wrap up about the high profile movie  'The Day After Tomorrow'  from CCNET (a 'scholarly electronic network' by personal subscription only to Benny Peiser – contact me if you want the details, it’s a great review for information scanners:)  Here's three highlights:  In ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" a $125 million disaster film set to open on May 28, global warming from accumulating smokestack and tailpipe gases disrupts warm ocean currents and sets off an instant ice age. Few climate experts think such a prospect is likely, especially in the near future.  But the prospect that moviegoers will be alarmed enough to blame the Bush administration for inattention to climate change has stirred alarm at the space agency, scientists there say. -- Andrew C Revkin, The New York Times, 25 April 2004   So, NASA scientists will be available for interviews. What, then, is the whole fuss about? Is this just another case of hyped up journalism or simply an attempt to rouse controversy which is always an effective and cheap way to promote a bad film? Actually, there seems to be more to this mini-storm than meets the eye. It would appear that the New York Times failed to reveal the real scandal behind the story -  the as yet undisclosed relationship between NASA and the film producers! --Benny Peiser, 26 April 2004  What these people forget is that if the melting ice caps disrupt the Gulf Stream and lower temperatures, this cooling will stop the ice from melting and the process will grind to a halt. When you look at ocean floor sediments, you see that the world has experienced temperatures far higher than those expected to be triggered by the greenhouse effect. When rises in temperatures occurred there was no sudden drop as the ice age enthusiasts predict will happen this time. --Doug Benn, St Andrews University, 25 April 2004"	m

Not that Genie would mess it up but me on the other hand...) and then theres always camping which I am also very skeptical about. Meh?

"Well, here I am in San Antonio for Father's Day.  I got here yesterday, and mom and I went to go see The Terminal with Tom Hanks.  It was a good movie.  Tom Hanks has got to be one of the most versatile and talented actors out there.  It's funny though, even with his foreign accent, he still maintains some of the classic ""Tom Hanks"" gestures and tonal inflections.  Anyway, good movie.  I would recommend it.  Today mom and I are going to go to this store called The Bombay Company that my mom's been wanting to show me for a while.  Apparently they have really nice home furnishings for decent prices.  Then tonight we are making dinner at home for Father's Day.  My old friend from Texas State, Paris (Matt Sharp) is coming over for dinner.  I haven't seen him in a long time so it will be good to catch up.  We're about to step out, so I'll post more later.    Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there reading my blog... or to all of you sons and daughters, I hope you're enjoying the day with your dad."	f
And now for today’s Spooning Fork...   urlLink     ‘Do I Move You?’ from  Anthology    Whatever else she may have been,  urlLink Nina Simone  could be queen of the barn-burner when she wanted. When  urlLink Austin Powers  lost his  urlLink mojo , he would have needed little more than this song, the epitome of what I like to call the smokey-bar blues, to regain it. How could you not instantly want to get down-’n-dirty when exposed to this potent 2:45 siren song? Just listen to those wailing harmonicas ... Struggling with bedroom eyes, folks?  Here’s your ticket.     And yet, in ‘Do I Move You?’ Nina manages to pose that one question worse than “Do I look fat?” By the end of the song, she’s got him backed up against a wall or the bed — you just know it. I’ll wager the man she was singing to felt not just a little terror should he fail to demonstrate adequate satisfaction. Come to think of it, this might just be the number capable to teaching men to  urlLink fake an orgasm  ...   When I touch you, do you quiver ...  from your head down to your liver.  If you like it, let me know it!  The answer better be “Yes .... yes ...   Great God Almighty, that pleases me!”    Other assorted ‘findings’ from this week ...         urlLink Tantric sex  = good, but may result with control-freak men.  (Tidbit from another writer, shared at a rooftop Brooklyn barbeque.)          Messenger bags are hot when worn by women. Which is to say, the way the strap separates our breasts is hot. I guess they just like spread in general ...  (Inside scoop from a guy friend, shared over dinner in a French cafe.)      Law school is the baby-clock for men. Women who age fear they’re too old to still have natural-born children. Men who age fear they’re too old to still take a stab at law school.  (Insight gained from cocktail chitchat with a bunch of current and aspiring lawyers.)   Narcissism is hip again! Recent comments from anonymous readers indicate my failure to use the cover of anonymity to reveal deep, personal secrets of the Broadway story is, well, a disappointment.  Too bad there wasn’t a reply-to email so I could share the “ urlLink Earl ” of my other blog .  That said, sometime this week I’ll try to post the story of either my meeting with The Latin American, or the backstory on The Harvard Lickwit.

"Song of the Day:  Kill Your Name- My Friend Ehab  Mood:  Looking Up  yea, haven't blogged in a long time.  I tried the livejournal thing for a little bit, but I ended up liking blogger better.  Anyways, a shitload of stuff has been happening.  I am probably going to my cousin's band Designed by You first concert on Friday.  It should be intense...his other band 9 Miles 2 Go got on an Asian Man Record compilation awhile ago, and it has sold over 20,000 copies.  The guitarist quit, so the bass player moved to guitar and vocals, and my cousin filled in the bass spot.  They haven't updated their site in awhile so my cousin isnt on it yet.  There producer wants to send them to New York to record and he will pay for everything...lucky...Their producer is the same guy that made Verve Pipe big, they had that song on the radio awhile ago that went, ""we were merely freshman"" or something.  Then on the 20th is the Suicide Machines concert that is gonna be the concert  of the century! Fordirelifesake is gonna be there, and they are pretty good, but The Suicide Machines will kick ass.  As for the band, Mike got kicked out, and Marty Layne is now the bass player and Ben moved to drums.  We are gonna record and EP soon, and hopefully do a small show in 2 weeks.  check out the  urlLink site.  and sign the guestbook.  This weekend I might see this girl Aimee from Novi, she's really cool.  The girl I was talking about in my last post from like a month ago, turned out to be a whore/druggie.  And you know...that isnt too good...  Me and my dad are gonna go see The Missing soon...so cya!  ""Life gets harder everyday, I'll do my best to show up."" -Nobody Care"	m

A special thanks to those of you who were able to attend the services held yesterday for my grandfather, it was greatly appreciated.  If you are a believer in the circle of life concept, then you know that with every end comes a new beginning.  Such is true here also...just as my grandfather passed away, I was offered a teaching position at a middle school in St. Bernard.  I will be teaching seventh grade English starting in January.  I am very excited that the job came my way and it was too great of an opportunity to pass up, so I will be venturing into the working world soon enough.  More news to come in the next few days, so have a good weekend and check back next week for some more updates.  Until then, remember that snow can also be spelled sneaux (just ask the kids at the LSU Lab School!)	f
"Normally I leave Big Brother commentary to those who are  urlLink better at it than I am , but I just can't leave last Sunday's eviction show without commenting on it.  For those that did not see it, the 5th evictee, Merlin, walked down the plank to the stage. He put gaffa tape on his mouth, help up a sign ""free the refugees"" and refused to talk to Gretel (who handled it fabulously given the circumstances), with sexy results.  Now, there were two great things that came out of this show. Firstly, it showed tremendous courage on Merlin's part. Secondly, I think it showed a new, young side of Australia that is really encouraging - and rare - to see on national television.  When Merlin jumped out of the car, you could see that he was extremely nervous. There were thousands (is it thousands? I looked like it) of people cheering him on. He fiddled with the sign and the tape for a while and everyone was collectively wondering ""what the hell is he up to?"". And then he pulled it out. A shitty sign with ""Free the Refugees"" on it. And it gets better... he WALKED RIGHT PAST GRETEL AND SAT DOWN, gaffa tape on, and refused to talk. I nearly peed my pants from that one! But you could see it in his eyes - he looked like he wanted to cry, apologise and take it all back, but he stood his ground.  I just have to say that it was phenomenally brave of Merlin to do such a thing, with the audience booing (why?!), and Gretel trying to salvage what was left of the eviction show. It was one of those great moments in television... where a leftie got one over the big guys :)  The main thing that surprised me, however, is the way the housemates reacted to Merlin's message. We hear on talkback radio that refugees are ""dangerous terrorists"", that the majority of Australians support mandatory detention, and that to support their freedom would be ""unAustralian"". But I saw something very different. For me it showed a huge cultural shift that represents how Generation X  Y are ignored in public debate. Sure, Big Brother is hardly representative of young Australia, but its all we've got for now... and I liked what I saw. People who were tolerant of Merlin's opinion (and most even agreed with him), had great respect for him and defended him over and over.  The way the housemates reacted gave me more than pure voyeuristic pleasure - it gave me a sense of confidence that things will eventually be ok. Baby boomers dominate the political scene, and whilst it is their democratic right to do so, we often lose sight of the younger generations' opinions - generally opinions supportive of multiculturalism, diversity, postmodern theory, and most importantly, a strong sense of justice.  It sure made me feel good for a fleeting moment. Of course, then I read the newspaper again and I turned into a frustrated young person again. But hey, it was a special moment, even if it did only last an hour.    Good on ya Merlin..."	f

"Happy belated 4rth of July!!!!!!!!  Can you believe that school will be starting again in just over a month? Time hella flies the older you get...before you know it... MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! hahahha...  my weekend was  FABULOUS!  Rich and I spent the 4rth with his dear friends... who are my friends now too (hehehhehe).... swimming, eating, playing pingo-pong, singing karaoke, getting mad drunk, and dominating the dangerous white waters of cache creek!! (okay... so the waters weren't that dangerous.... but Jeremy's rodeo riding a$$ sure made it one bumpy ride!!!)  I made a lot of new friends this weekend.....and it totally reflects what kind of guy Rich really is..... it's totally true that you can tell what type of person someone is just by seeing who they hang out with.... Rich has such a great and genuine ora that surrounds his life day to day... no wonder he is so wonderful....   I've come to learn that in order to get to where you want... you have to surround yourself with things that can help you get there.... no distractions no drama... just affection, motivation, success, genuineness (is that even a word?..oh well...) ... i also believe that no one can ever tell you different but yourself... but how must easier will it be if you don't ever have to take the effort to avoid distractions....just don't head in the direction of having to avoid anything....just cruise on forward...  I'm 22... and I need the motivation and I need the focus.... I am determined.... but things happen in life that unfortunately side track you.... I want to finish my school so badly that I'm scared that I may fail.... I'm scared that I won't be able to.... don't get me wrong...i have the confidence in myself that i will succeed and finish.... but there's always this ""what if"" in the back of my mind that just keeps me at the edge of my seat...... but you know what? that ""what if"" in the back of my mind has been quiet lately.... and I think it has a lot to do with Rich.... yeah on the outside he's this dorky goofball.... but inside.... his heart is wholesome and his intelligence admirable.... I've always been the one to have to take care of other people... to look out for other people.... people would come to me for all the questions and answers..... i had to be the strong one in the relationship to make things work.......... but not with rich.... he's my partner at everything..... speaking for me when I am speechless.... removing items from my plate when i couldn't hold it....when I am fragile and weak..... he makes me strong.... and he tells me the truth..... even when it's criticism..... he makes me suck it up and take it........ cuz i know he has the best interest at heart............ he not only wants to be part of my life...but he wants me to be part of his....and with him i'm capable to do anything..... he says that he loves that i'm so ""gung-ho"".... and you know what? i love it too..... even when i'm irritated... at my wits end.......... for some reason or other..... my heart and my mind can clear up the frustration and know that i deserve him in my life..... he makes me better.... and because of him....my life is better.....................  He is my hamachi in my sushi..............and i LLLLOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEE hamachi!!!!!!!!!!"	f

"INSPIRATION FROM THE ODDEST PLACES   I received the new issue of  Entertainment Weekly  on Saturday and was looking through it while I ate lunch.  It's one of my guilty pleasures.  It's the only way that I appear to know about  Friends  even though I never watch TV.  There was an interesting article in there about Dr. Sharon Mitchell, a former porn star and drug addict.  After being attacked by a crazed fan in 1996, she went back to school and got her PhD in human sexuality and opened the Adult Industry Medical Health Foundation (AIM).  After porn actor, Darren James, and porn actress, Lara Roxx, recently tested positve for HIV, she was able to halt production of adult movies for 60-days in the Los Angeles area.    First, it's nice to know that the adult film industry has some measures in place to try and prevent the spread of HIV among its actors.  More amazingly, I am surprised that it has been as successful as it has until this major outbreak, which nothing of its kind has happened since 1998.  Still, it's good to know that something is in place instead of nothing at all.  Still, you would think they would require condom use at all times.  Secondly, I think it's very inspiring that a woman who has slipped away into stripping in clubs to support her heroin habit, is beaten so badly, it sends her a wake up call that something has got to change.  What does she do?  She goes back to school for the training she needs to help others from her former industry.  Some of the services she has extended to clients include: birth control; drug and alcohol counseling; information on how to get in and out of the porn industry safely; scholarship program; medical checkups; and STD screenings.  Many people may have felt that there was no point in bettering themselves because they were too old and too set in their ways to change.  It's too hard.  Why bother?    I was reading an essay in Michal Thomas Ford's My Big Fat Queer Life and it had something to do with how silly porn was.  He mentioned the deaths of Joey Stefano, who I knew died of a drug overdose, and Ryan Idol, who fell or was pushed out of the window of his Manhattan hotel.  This sounded very mysterious so I decided to research it a little.  As it turns out, Ryan survived the fall from his fourth story window.  It's actually an amazing story.  He landed on an awning that broke his fall and he was so drunk that it distributed the impact more evenly through out his body.   urlLink Here  is an interesting article I found about the incident, his stage career and opinions on how he may or may not be using the gay community.  I've never been a big fan of porn.  I've always felt it is sort of like alcohol.  When used in moderation, it can be enjoyed by some people.  However, with excessive use, it can destroy lives.  In the late 80s and early 90s, my best friend, Kent, had a msyterious porn collection.  I would go over to his apartment and he would have stacks of gay porn magazines.  It was then that I learned the significance of Cyndi Lauper looking at the pages of a  Blue Boy  magazine in  She-Bop , the world's greatest anthem on the right for maturbation tolerance.  Knowing that he was a college student like myself, I knew he didn't have the money to buy all of these.  The magazines weren't cheap.  He said that friends gave them to him.  I never met those friends and always wondered about who they were and what exchange may have transpired for these magazines.   Ken would hand me several magazines to puruse as he finished getting ready to go out.  They're really not doctor's office or hair salon reading material, are they?  I mean the purpose of porn is to titilate with the expectation that one is going to manually self-stimulate oneself.  It's not like you're going to whip it out at the doctor's office and go to town or tell your hair dresser, ""Oh, let me just switch my Butterly vibrator off.  I was picking up some good vibrations.""  Furthermore, when I venture into any territory outside my upbringing, my mother's voice usually accompanies me.  As you flip through the pages and you see some smooth model type with a big grin on his face as he holds his legs up in the air to expose his perky and pink anus, the only thing I can think of is, ""You know, he can never run for political office now.""  My mother's voice says, ""What would his mother think?""  Granted, I think at one time or another, we've all wondered what it would be like to runaway and do something wild like pose nude for a photographer or buy toothpaste without out a coupon, but we know we would never do it.  I'm not ashamed of my body, but it doesn't necessarily warrant that I present my spinchter to the world for general viewing.  Plus, I don't particurlarly want my mom and dad to see my genitals on parade, thank you very much.  On the other hand, I read an interview with porn actor is some local periodical about how his mother runs his fan club and helps hime choose which nude pictures to submit to magazines.     ""Which picture do you like best Ma?  The cowboy, the biker or the all American boy-next-door?""    ""I like the all American one.  You've got a bigga hard-on.""   So there was one particulary magazine that I actually liked to read.  I think it was called Man Shots and they had interviews with the directors and actors as well as pictures.  Kent would always tease me for reading the articles, but I thought they were fascinating.  I had no idea how huge the porn industry is in the United States, let alone the rest of the world.  It is a well organized, finely tuned machine.  It was enlightening to discover what a director looks for in an actor/model and what reasons led some performers to get involved in the industry.  Sadly, Kent's porn collection is gone.  I went to visit him when his sick once and staying with his mother.  As I was leaving, he said he wanted to return my box of books.  I told him that he didn't have any of my books.  He expressed with much emphasis that he did indeed have some of my books.  I suddenly understood that I was to be the care taker of his porn while he was living at home.  My friend, Tacy, had gone with me to visit Kent.  As we drove away, I rifled through the box and was amazed at the collection.  It had all changed.  There were movies too.  For some reason, Chip Off The Old Block sounds familiar.  The box remained with me for several years.  In fact, at one point, it was even in my parents' attic in storage.  I eventually through it all away.  At one point, I was going to cut all of the erect penises out and write a poem with them on a canvas.  Sadly, it never happened.  I don't own any porn and I sometimes feel like a cowboy without a horse.  How can I be a gay man without porn?  I've often flirted with the idea of buying a movie just to keep around the house in case I ever decide I want to watch it.  The idea of just knowing it's there in case I want to watch it soothes me, but trying to pick out a particular title among the thousands of titles gives me a headache.  I'm very particular about the regular movies I own, I would imagine I would be even more specific with a blue movie.  In the end, I can't say that I have missed anything over the years.  In closing, I did find an  urlLink interesting Web site  in my research for Ryan Idol last night.  It's a site that lists deceased porn stars and how they died.  It seems like many of them left this mortal coil in some most unpleasant ways.  I don't know the numbers for regular actors in the porn industry, but the ratio of deaths by tragic circumstances may be small in comparison to the number of actors as a whole.  However, I would say that in an industry where drug and alcohol use are common, it does not seem surprising.  As I read the names and the circumstances of death,  I found myself pitying these people, but then I changed my mind.  Don't we all face challenges no matter who we choose to spend time with or which profession we go into.  Whether it's learning to tell our boss to get his or her own coffee extracting ourselves from the clutches of a craze fan who is beating the crap out of us, they are all opportunities for growth and it is what we make of those opportunities that counts."	m
